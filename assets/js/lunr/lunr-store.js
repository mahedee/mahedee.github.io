        "title": "Uses of Once as Conjunction",
        "excerpt":"When used as a conjunction, “once” is used to express the idea of “as soon as” or “after”. It is often used to indicate a condition or action that must be completed before another action can take place. The basic sentence structure is:   Once + [condition or action] + [resulting action]   Here are some examples based on different tenses:   Present tense:     Once + [simple present tense], [simple present tense]   Once he finishes his work, he goes to the gym.   Once she finishes her homework, she can go outside and play.   Once he gets his driver’s license, he will be able to drive to school.   Past tense:     Once + [simple past tense], [simple past tense]   Once she finished her dinner, she went to bed.   Once we arrived at the airport, we checked in our luggage.   Once they finished their meal, they paid the bill and left the restaurant.   Future tense:     Once + [simple present tense], [simple future tense]   Once they understand the rules, they will play the game.   Once I graduate from college, I plan to travel for a year.   Once they save enough money, they will buy a house.   In each of these examples, “once” is used to introduce a condition or action that must occur before the resulting action can take place. The use of “once” implies that the condition or action is expected to happen relatively soon or in the near future. The resulting action is usually expressed in the simple present, simple past, or future tense, depending on the context.   Here are some examples of using “once” as a conjunction in the passive voice:   Present tense:     Once the work is finished, the report will be reviewed by the manager.   Once the package is delivered, a confirmation email will be sent.   Past tense:     Once the project was completed, a presentation was given to the stakeholders.   Once the document was signed, it was filed in the cabinet.   Future tense:     Once the tickets are bought, the seats will be assigned by the airline.   Once the task is done, the progress will be updated by the team leader.   In each of these examples, the passive voice is used to emphasize the object of the sentence rather than the subject. The use of “once” as a conjunction indicates that the action is conditional and that the resulting action will happen after the condition has been met. The use of the passive voice adds a sense of formality or objectivity to the sentence.  ","categories": ["Grammar","English"],

        "title": "Learn About Microsoft SQL Server Disaster Recovery Best Practices",
        "excerpt":"Disaster Recovery is one of the burning issues in today’s tech world. While data has become the most important component of business, the rate of data loss, data deletion, and data corruption is increasing. You never know when a disaster might occur and attack our database. Therefore, you have to prepare ourselves to deal with any disaster. Precautions about disaster in equally important for SQL Server user. SQL Database is often vulnerable to different natural and man-created disasters. To safeguard the data, it is necessary to have complete knowledge about Microsoft SQL Server disaster recovery best practices. In this post, we will share with you some of Disaster Recovery practices that are considered as the best.   Best Practices Of SQL Server Disaster Recovery   The most effective practices of SQL Disaster Recovery involve looking into the database architecture and create solutions for every possible situation. The solutions can involve backup and other measures of data protection. Let us learn about all the best Disaster Recovery practices.      Design a Solution that Properly Addresses the Problem   While creating a solution for any problem, you have to make sure that it does not end up creating more problems. Though no design can be called perfect, you must focus on developing the best design that is capable of solving the problem and provide enhanced opportunity. While doing this, always note down why you picked up this particular design over others and how can this meet your goal of solving the problem. At times, when improvement in the solution is expected, design must be compatible with the current SQL Server version. Also, consider the impacts of changes on all the dependent materials, if you are planning to make any changes.      Find out Possible Weakness of the Solution   No solution design is completely flawless and that is why it is crucial to accept the limitations. This acknowledgment will help you to prepare for the disaster in a better way. There is no shame in having solutions with limited capabilities because of restricted resources and changing circumstances. But the main issue lies in accepting it and find about about automated solutions that can fulfill the limitations of the design. The same policy should be followed in other cases like active-active replication, availability group, etc.           Consider All other Possible Situations  Usually, the solution design and its limitations are evaluated based on our knowledge. But what if something else happens that you are not even considering at this point? Your knowledge (or the lack of it) can be your weak point. To counter these issues, you can consider hiring a consultant/ expert to check the design and find out its limitations.            Create the Solution  After you find out about all the possible flaws of your design, you need to create the solution as soon as possible. The solution can be anything: backup restoration or Server addition. But, it should be created without wasting any time as you do not know when the disaster might happen. The more you wait, the more risk you put your data into.            Drill, Drill, and Drill  The most important thing after setting up the Disaster Recovery Solution is to practice/ drill it. Without drilling, the complete Disaster Recovery project remains incomplete. For drilling, you can re-create the situation in a test environment and then run the solution. Do not forget to have a backup of the solution. Saving the solution script in the test environment without backup can put you in danger if the Server fails.            Train Junior DBAs  Drilling for Disaster Recovery is the best time to train the database admins who are new in this profession. Through simulation, they can be prepared for the worst situations that may occur to cover by themselves. Through practices, junior DBAs become comfortable with the “state of panic” and learn how to handle the situation.            Coordination between All the teams  In case of large-sized environments, the entire disaster recovery procedure should be done by coordinating with multiple teams like DB Admin team, System team and Developer team. In organizations that do not have this type of team division, coordination must involve everyone who might become affected by the disaster.            Appreciation and Incentive  Do not forget to appreciate yourself and everyone else involved in creating the solution and drilling it. Acknowledgment of all the good work done will function as the incentive for future.            SQL Recovery Tool As The Last Resort For Data Recovery  These are some of the best practices that can be done to protect SQL Server database during any disaster. However, these cannot assure the foolproof safety of your database items. If you have lost data from your database due to any disaster, you can take the help of SQL Recovery Tool. This application can retrieve all the deleted data from your database regardless of the cause of data loss. This application is suitable for all the latest versions of SQL Server including SQL 2017.       Conclusion  In this post, we have depicted Microsoft SQL Server Disaster Recovery best practices. Reading this, users will become aware of the practices that should be performed to ensure maximum protection against the disasters. If you still lose some data, use SQL Recovery to get back lost data of your database.   Author: Andrew Jackson  ","categories": ["SQL Server","Database"],

        "title": "Configure service mesh using Istio with an asp.net core applications on Kubernetes",
        "excerpt":"Overview   A service mesh is a configurable infrustructure layer. It have capabilities to handle service-to-service communication, resilency, and many cross-cutting concerns. Proxy is a key component of service mesh. Sidecar proxy is injected in each services in this concept. Here I will show you service mesh communication using Istio with asp.net core applications on Kubernetes environment.   Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow accross microservices, enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data. Istio uses following tools -      Prometheus: It monitors everything in the cluster.   Grafana: Data visualization tools.   Jaeger: It’s used for distributed tracing.   Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies used to configure Istio     Visual Studio 2022   Visual C#   ASP.NET Core Web API   Ocelot   Docker desktop   Kubernetes   Istio   Let’s configure Istio on asp.net core web api applications.   Step 1: Download Istio     Go to the link below and download “istio-1.12.2-win.zip”  https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.12.2   or download and extract the latest release automatically (Linux or macOS): curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -           Extract zip file and move to the Istio Package directory. For example, istio-1.12.2.            Then installation directory contains:             Sample applications in sample/directory       The istioctl client binary in the bin/directory           Step 2: Add istioctl client to your path      Use the following command in git bash to add istioctl client to your path.   export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH   Note: The above command doesn’t run on powershell. So, use git bash. If you close the git bash, istioctl doesn’t work. You have to run the above command again.      To check istioctl client use the following command in git bash.   istioctl   Step 3: Install Istio      For installation, we use the demo configuration profile. It’s selected to have a good set of defaults for testing, but there are other profiles for production or performance testing. Use below command to install Istio.   istioctl install --set profile=demo -y     Use the following command to verify Istio.   kubectl get all -n istio-system   Output:   NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE pod/istio-egressgateway-c9cbbd99f-wk265     1/1     Running   0          87s pod/istio-ingressgateway-7c8bc47b49-xpvvc   1/1     Running   0          86s pod/istiod-765596f7ff-2p72v                 1/1     Running   0          3m13s  NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                                      AGE service/istio-egressgateway    ClusterIP      10.101.157.106   &lt;none&gt;        80/TCP,443/TCP                                                               85s service/istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.109.205.109   localhost     15021:32149/TCP,80:30563/TCP,443:30960/TCP,31400:32369/TCP,15443:32309/TCP   85s service/istiod                 ClusterIP      10.109.211.149   &lt;none&gt;        15010/TCP,15012/TCP,443/TCP,15014/TCP                                        3m12s  NAME                                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE deployment.apps/istio-egressgateway    1/1     1            1           87s deployment.apps/istio-ingressgateway   1/1     1            1           86s deployment.apps/istiod                 1/1     1            1           3m13s  NAME                                              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE replicaset.apps/istio-egressgateway-c9cbbd99f     1         1         1       87s replicaset.apps/istio-ingressgateway-7c8bc47b49   1         1         1       86s replicaset.apps/istiod-765596f7ff                 1         1         1       3m13s   Step 4: Configure for auto proxy injection      Add a namespace label to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies when you deploy your application later. Use below command to configure default namespance with Istio sidecar proxy.   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled      Check label by using below command   kubectl describe namespace default   Step 5: Create asp.net core applications      Create 4 asp.net core web api projects.   Projects names are Catalog.API, Location.API, Ordering.API and BFF.Web.   Step 6: Organize Catalog.API Project      Add the following nuget packages in the project.   Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools      Add a model class name Product in the model folder.

To configure pod and service add the following yml file with code in Deploy/k8s folder   deployment.yml    apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: bffweb-deployment spec:   selector:     matchLabels:       app: bffweb-pod   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: bffweb-pod     spec:       containers:       - name: bffweb-container         image: mahedee/bff.web:1.0.1         resources:           limits:             memory: \"128Mi\"             cpu: \"500m\"         ports:         - containerPort: 80  ---  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: bffweb-service spec:   selector:     app: bffweb-pod   ports:   - port: 8011     targetPort: 80   type: LoadBalancer        Go to the Deploy/k8s directory and run the following commands.   kubectl apply -f .\\deployment.yml      Now you can running services using in the kubernetes using the following command   kubectl get svc   Output:    NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE bffweb-service        LoadBalancer   10.111.186.235   localhost     8011:31690/TCP   10m catalogapi-service    LoadBalancer   10.101.130.94    localhost     8001:30710/TCP   138m kubernetes            ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP          3d20h locationapi-service   ClusterIP      10.100.204.33    &lt;none&gt;        8002/TCP         7m57s orderingapi-service   LoadBalancer   10.96.12.11      localhost     8003:31264/TCP   15m       You can now access catalog api, location api and ordering api using bffweb using the following URL        You can use postman for CRUD Operation       http://localhost:8011/Catalog/api/Products/GetAll       http://localhost:8011/Location/api/Countries/GetAll       http://localhost:8011/Ordering/api/Orders/GetAll       Visualizing Service Mesh   Step 11: Install Kiali dashboard      Go to the Istio’s directory. Install Kiali and other addons and wait for them to be deployed. Execute below command inside Istio folder. Use Git bash instead of powershell.   kubectl apply -f samples/addons      Execute below command and wait till get success roll out message.   kubectl rollout status deployment/kiali -n istio-system   Note: If there are errors trying to install the addons, try running the command again. There may be some timing issues which will be resolved when the command is run again.      Verify the deployment with below command.   kubectl get po -n istio-system   Output:   NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE grafana-6ccd56f4b6-sc894                1/1     Running   0          13m istio-egressgateway-c9cbbd99f-wk265     1/1     Running   0          87m istio-ingressgateway-7c8bc47b49-xpvvc   1/1     Running   0          87m istiod-765596f7ff-2p72v                 1/1     Running   0          89m jaeger-5d44bc5c5d-g2wcl                 1/1     Running   0          13m kiali-79b86ff5bc-cqwrp                  1/1     Running   0          13m prometheus-64fd8ccd65-lglld             2/2     Running   0          13m      Now run the Kiali dashboard using the below command   istioctl dashboard kiali  Kiali dashboard will be open.  Hit the gateway URL. Use the following URL and hit several times and you will get the reflect in kiali dashbaord as below.   http://localhost:8011/Catalog/api/Products/GetAll   http://localhost:8011/Location/api/Countries/GetAll   http://localhost:8011/Ordering/api/Orders/GetAll      Step 12: Monitoring with Prometheus &amp; Grafana      Check Prometheus and Grafana is running using the following command.   kubectl get po -n istio-system      Run Prometheus dashboard using the following command   istioctl dashboard prometheus   View graph in diffrent ways like -      Select istio_requests_total.   Switch to Graph.   Check Status/Targets - Kubernetes service discovery.         Run Grafana dashboard using the following command   istioctl dashboard grafana     Go to Dashboar-&gt;Manage-&gt;Istio and see the dashboar as below.      Step 13: Distributed Tracing using Jaegar UI      Run Jaeger UI using the following command   istioctl dashboard jaeger      Step 14: Logging from Istio and Envoy      Create a YAML file and name the file elasticsearch.yaml  and write below code.   elasticsearch.yaml   # Logging Namespace.

        "excerpt":"এক স্বর্ণকারের মৃত্যুর পর তার পরিবারটা বেশ সংকটে পড়ে গেলো। খাদ্য-বস্ত্রে দেখা দিল চরম অভাব।  স্বর্ণকারের বিধবা স্ত্রী তার বড় ছেলেকে একটা হীরের হার দিয়ে বললো–এটা তোমার কাকার দোকানে নিয়ে যাও সে যেন এটা বেচে কিছু টাকার ব্যবস্থা করে দেয়   ছেলেটা হারটি নিয়ে কাকার কাছে গেল। কাকা হারটা ভালো করে পরীক্ষা করে বললো- বেটা, তোমার মাকে গিয়ে বলবে যে এখন বাজার খুবই মন্দা, কয়েকদিন পর বিক্রি করলে ভাল দাম পাওয়া যাবে। কাকা কিছু টাকা ছেলেটিকে দিয়ে বললেন–আপাতত এটা নিয়ে যাও আর কাল থেকে তুমি প্রতিদিন দোকানে আসবে আমি কোন ১দিন ভাল খদ্দোর পেলেই যেন তুমি দৌড়ে হার নিয়ে আসতে পার তাই সারাদিন থাকবে।   পরের দিন থেকে ছেলেটা রোজ দোকানে যেতে লাগলো।সময়ের সাথে সাথে সেখানে সোনা-রুপা-হীরে কাজ শিখতে আরম্ভ করলো। ভাল শিক্ষার ফলে অল্প দিনেই খুব নামি জহুরত বনে গেল। দূর দূরান্ত থেকে লোক তার কাছে সোনাদানা বানাতে ও পরীক্ষা করাতে আসত। খুবই প্রসংশীত হচ্ছিল তার কাজ।   একদিন ছেলেটির কাকা বললো– তোমার মাকে গিয়ে বলবে যে এখন বাজারের অবস্থা বেশ ভালো, তাই সেই হারটা যেন তোমার হাতে দিয়ে দেন। এখন এটা বিক্রি করলে ভালো দাম পাওয়া যাবে।   ছেলেটি ঘরে গিয়ে মায়ের কাছ থেকে হারটি নিয়ে পরীক্ষা করে দেখলো যে এটা একটা নকল হীরের হার। তাই সে হারটা আর কাকার কাছে না নিয়ে বাড়িতেই. রেখে দিলো।   কাকা জিজ্ঞেস করলো– হারটি এনেছো ?ছেলেটি বললো– না কাকা পরীক্ষা করে দেখলাম এটা একটা নকল হার।   তখন কাকা বললো- তুমি যেদিন আমার কাছে হারটি প্রথম নিয়ে এসেছিলে সেদিন আমি দেখেই বুঝে নিয়েছিলাম যে এটা নকল, কিন্তু তখন যদি আমি তোমাকে এই কথাটা বলে দিতাম, তাহলে তোমরা হয়তো ভাবতে যে আজ আমাদের মন্দা সময় বলেই কাকা আমাদের আসল জিনিষকে নকল বলছে।   আজ যখন এ ব্যাপারে তোমার পুরো জ্ঞান হয়ে গেছে, তখন তুমি নিজেই বলছো এটা নকল হার। এই দুনিয়াতে প্রকৃত জ্ঞান ছাড়া তুমি যা কিছু দেখছো যা কিছু ভাবছো সবটাই এই হারের মতই নকল, মিথ্যে।   জ্ঞান ছাড়া কোন জিনিসের বিচার সম্ভব নয়। আর এই ভ্রমের শিকার হয়েই অনেক সম্পর্ক শেষ হয়ে যায়। তোমাদের সাথে আমার সেই সম্পর্কটা নষ্ট হোক আমি তা চাইনি।।   সংগৃহিত  ","categories": ["Bangla","Lesson Learned","Story","Collected"],

        "title": "Procedural VS Object Oriented Programming",
        "excerpt":"Object Oriented and Procedural are two programming paradigm. Procedural programming creates a step by step program that guides the application through a sequence of instructions. Procedural programming is also called linear programming. Generally, code is executed from the top of the file to the bottom in procedural programming. Object Oriented uses object to design applications and computer programs. It isn’t as linear as procedural programming. Code is often broken up and distributed across multiple files, each one with a single purpose.           Programming Style: Procedural is linear programming and OOP is not linear programing.            Fundamental Unit: Function is the fundamental unit of procedural programming and object is the fundamental unit of OOP.            Code Organization: In procedural programming code is organized into small procedures. This procedure is used to perform any operation. In object oriented programming, the data and related functions are bundled together into an object.            Data Orientation: In procedural programming functions have no intrinsic relationship with the data they operate on. Here, you provide the correct number and type of arguments, the function will do its work and returns its output. In object oriented programming, the data and related functions are bundled together into an “object”. Ideally, the data   inside an object can only be manipulated by calling the object’s functions.            Global and Shared data: We can see that one of the principle differences is that procedural systems make use of shared and global data, while object oriented systems lock their data privately away in objects.            Reusability: Reusability is one of the best features of OOP. Reusability is higher than procedural programming.       Abstraction: Abstraction of OOP is higher than procedural programming so maintenance is easy.        Inheritance: Inheritance is the key of OOP but Procedural programming doesn’t support inheritance.            Encapsulation &amp; Polymorphism: Encapsulation and polymorphism is two key features of OOP which are absent in procedural programming.            Coupling and Cohesion: Loosely couple and maximum cohesion in the system is only possible by OOP but it is not possible by procedural programming.       Cost: OOP takes less cost than Procedural programming.  ","categories": ["OOP"],

        "title": "Basic concepts of Business Intelligence (BI)",
        "excerpt":"What is BI?   Business Intelligence (BI) is a computer based technique to identified, extracting (*1) and analyzing business data. For example senior management of an industry can inspect sales revenue by products and/or departments, or by associated costs and incomes. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. So, management can take some strategic or operation decision easily.      Why BI?   BI is used for reporting, online analytical processing, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining and productive analysis .By using BI, management can monitor objectives from high level , understand what is happening, why is happening and can take necessary steps why the objectives are not full filled. Business intelligence aims to support better business decision-making. Thus a BI system can be called a decisions support system (DSS).   Before going to launch any product, company need to understand of market trend. Company uses BI to analyze market data and understand which product or which business is suitable for the current time in the market. In a word, BI gives you right information, right time in right format.   Suppose a software company wants to develop an ERP. Before going to develop an ERP, company’s business executive need to better understand of its development cost. Potentiality of it’s sells volume. Management need to understand that will it protect margins. To understand the above factors they have to have consolidated views of business. BI provides this visual and consolidates view. From this reports, company can take necessary action and can take decision whether they should develop an ERP or not.   Now suppose your ERP is developing and your management can see the current situation of the project. They have no time to see all the documents. They want to view the current status of the project from the top. This may be dashboard, BI provides this. So management can understand whether the product is developing cost effective way or not. BI can suggest corrective action against the data.   Sample sales Dashboard:      Prerequisites   Before implementing a BI solution, it is worth taking different factors into consideration before proceeding. According to Kimball et al., these are the three critical areas that you need to assess within your organization before getting ready to do a BI project.      The level of commitment and sponsorship of the project from senior management.   The level of business need for creating a BI implementation.   The amount and quality of business data available. Data can be gathered from Enterprise, department or individual.   How BI works?   BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes.   -Data warehousing and BI   Often BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse or data mart. However, not all data warehouses are used for business intelligence, nor do all business intelligence applications require a data warehouse. In order to distinguish between concepts of business intelligence and data warehouses, Forrester Research often defines business intelligence in one of two ways:   Boarder Definition: “Business Intelligence is a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making.” When using this definition, business intelligence also includes technologies such as data integration, data quality, data warehousing, master data management, text and content analytics, and many others that the market sometimes lumps into the Information Management segment. Therefore, Forrester refers to data preparation and data usage as two separate, but closely linked segments of the business intelligence architectural stack.   Forrester defines the latter, narrower business intelligence market as “referring to just the top layers of the BI architectural stack such as reporting, analytics and dashboards.”   -Business intelligence and business analytics   Thomas Davenport has argued that business intelligence should be divided into querying, reporting, OLAP, an “alerts” tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI based on statistics, prediction, and optimization.   Business Intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes (MARCKM), in order to drive business value:   MARCKM means – Measurement, Analytics, Reporting/Enterprise Reporting, Collaboration/Collaboration Platform, and Knowledge Management.   In addition to above, Business Intelligence also can provide a pro-active approach, such as ALARM function to alert immediately to end-user. There are many types of alerts, for example if some business value exceeds the threshold value the color of that amount in the report will turn RED and the Business Analyst is alerted. Sometimes an alert mail will be sent to the user as well. This end to end process requires data governance, which should be handled by the expert.   Semi-structured or unstructured data   Businesses collect a huge amount of valuable information. These information included in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material and news.   BI uses both structured and unstructured data, but the former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making. It is very difficult to identify which information is in unstructured data. Unstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, it refers to data that cannot be stored in columns and rows. It must be stored in a BLOB(binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most relational database management systems. Since it is difficult to search information from unstructured data so, what will organization do to extract information from unstructured data?   Metadata is only way to search information from unstructured data. Metadata is actually data about data. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation. This metadata can be stored in a database. So, it is easy to search by this metadata. To solve problems with search ability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. It is more useful would be metadata about the actual content – e.g. summaries, topics, people or companies mentioned.   There are many challenges to develop BI with semi-structured and structured data. Those are:   -Accessing unstructured data because it is stored in a variety of format.   -There is no standard terminology.   -Volume of data is so high   -Search ability of unstructured data is not easy.   Many BI tools are available now. The information delivery model is given below.      Data can be collected from different source.ETL (Extract, transform and load) is responsible to collect these data. Then these data are kept in data warehouse by ETL. Data warehouse can be sub divided into Data marts. OLAP provides these data to the BI tools users by OLAP Cubes. BI tools display these result to the users.   BI Tools:   Many BI tools are available now. Most of the organization follows-      Spreadsheet   Reporting and querying software: tools that extract, sort, summarize, and present selected data   Dashboards   Data mining   Data warehousing   Decision Engineering   Process Mining   Business Performance management   Local Information System   Microsoft introduced a new BI tool name-Dashboard. Dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives which fits in a single computer screen so it can be monitored at a glance – Stephen Few, Information Dashboard design.   Microsoft BI Solution – 2007 architecture.      Notes:   Data extraction is the act or process of retrieving data out of (usually unstructured or poorly structured) data source for further data processing or data storage. The import into the intermediate extracting system is thus usually followed by data transformation and possibly the addition of metadata prior to export to another stage in the data workflow. Usually, the term data extraction is applied when (experimental) data is first imported into a computer from primary sources, like measuring recording devices. Today’s electronic devices will usually present a electrical connector (e.g. USB) through which ‘raw data” can be streamed into a personal computer.  ","categories": ["BI"],

        "title": "Global variable of ASP.net",
        "excerpt":"Global variables are those variables that can be accessed anywhere in the application. Global variable should always be used with caution. It stores data. The most common way of accessing global variables in ASP.net are by using Application, Cache, and Session Objects.   Application – Application objects are application level global variables, that need to be shared for all user sessions. Thus, data specific to a user should’nt be saved in application objects. While using application objects, the objects are locked so that multiple page requests cannot access a specific application object. Below is a code example for usage of application object…   Application.Lock(); Application(\"UserData\") = \"dotnetuncle\"; Application.UnLock(); Response.Redirect(\"DestinationPage.aspx\"); //DestinationPage.aspx gets the value from the Application State String sString = Application(\"UserData\").ToString();     Cache – The cache object is similar to the application object in scope, however, it does not need any explicit locking and unlocking. Code below shows usage of Cache object…   Cache(\"Userdata\") = \"dotnetuncle\";   Response.Redirect(\"DestinationPage.aspx\");  //Destination.aspx retrieves the value from Cache object   String sString = Cache(\"Userdate\").ToString();    The cache object also shares data across all user sessions. The cache object has features like it can automatically expire cached content after specified time periods or once memory consumption has reached a maximum.   Session – The session object is used to store the data specific to a user for the entire length of a user’s visit to a website. Below is a code that shows usage of the session object in ASP.NET …   //InitialPage.aspx stores the user’s credentials in Session state   Session(\"UserName\") = txtUserName.Text;   Server.Transfer(\"DestinationPage.aspx\");    //DestinationPage.aspx gets the user’s name from Session state   String sString = Session(\"UserName\").ToString();       ASP.NET stores session values in the server memory. If there are plenty of active user’s of a website, then the memory consumption on the server increases by leaps. Because of this reason, large websites use very less Session Variables. Session state can be configured to be automatically stored in a SQL Server database, or it can be configured to be stored centrally in a state server within a server farm. By default, a user’s session ends 20 minutes after their last page request and their data goes out of scope, freeing it from memory. In case user information is to be tracked by a large website, then a oookie is preferred.   Cookie – A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on a user’s browser. Thus, a cookie does not use any server memory.  ","categories": ["ASP.NET","C#"],

        "excerpt":"This topic for those who are very beginner of SQL. Here I will show some basic SQL by Microsoft SQL Server.   1. Create a table: Here I created a table name hrm_employee. Here emp_gid is int type, primary key and identity. Identity means its value will increment automatically by the sql server. You don’t need to insert it’s value.  --Create Table : hrm_employee--- CREATE TABLE hrm_employee (   emp_gid INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,   emp_fullnm VARCHAR(100),   emp_nicknm VARCHAR(50),   emp_designation VARCHAR(100) )  2. Insert data in hrm_employee table: In this occasion, I have inserted 3 data i.e 3 rows. If you see in closer look, you will see that I didn’t insert any value of emp_gid because it increments its value automatically because it is an identity column.  --Insert data ito table: hrm_employee----  -- Insert data i.e. row-1 --- INSERT INTO hrm_employee (   emp_fullnm,    emp_nicknm,    emp_designation ) VALUES ( 'Md. Mahedee Hasan',  'Mahedee',  'Senior Software Engineer' )  -- Insert data i.e. row-2 --- INSERT INTO hrm_employee ( emp_fullnm , emp_nicknm , emp_designation ) VALUES ( 'Md. Asrafuzzaman' , 'Emon' , 'Senior Software Engineer' )  -- Insert data i.e. row-3 --- INSERT INTO hrm_employee ( emp_fullnm , emp_nicknm , emp_designation ) VALUES ( 'Md. Khondakar Enamul Haque' , 'Rony' , 'Broadcast Engineer' )  3. Infromation Retrive: Get all information of hrm_employee. Here I showed two ways to retrive data and I suggest to use second one. Second one is best practiced.  --Get all data from hrm_employee-- SELECT * FROM hrm_employee --or SELECT emp_gid, emp_fullnm, emp_nicknm, emp_designation FROM hrm_employee  4. Update hrm_employee: Is very easy to update a row or multiple rows against a condition. Lets look on the following query.  --update data from table: hrm_employee -- UPDATE hrm_employee SET emp_fullnm = 'M.K. Enamul Haque' , emp_designation = 'Senior Broadcast Engineer' WHERE emp_gid = 3  5. Delete Information: If you want to delete information from hrm_employee against a condition follow the query.  ---Delete data from table: hrm_employee--- DELETE FROM hrm_employee WHERE emp_gid = 3  6. Drop Table: Drop table means remove table for database. Use the query to drop hrm_employee table.  ---Drop table i.e remove table from Database-- DROP TABLE hrm_employee  ","categories": ["SQL Server","Database"],

        "excerpt":"   Slow and steady wins the race.   A bad workman quarrels with his tools. - An inefficient man complains of cicrumstances.   A barking dog seldom or never bites. - Someone who makes threats all the time seldom carries out the threats.   A burnt child dreads the fire or Once bitten, twice shy. - Experience teaches us caution; if something has hurt you once, you avoid it after that.   When in Rome, do as the Romans do.   If one can do it, You too can do it. If none can do it, you must do it. - Japanese Proverb.   Don’t judge a book by its cover.   Better late than never.   The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.   Practice makes a man perfect.   The pen is mightier than the sword.   Actions speak louder than words.   Where there is a will, there is a way.   He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever - Chinese Proverb.   I hear: I forget. I see: I remember. I do: I understand. - Chinese proverb   A picture is worth a thousand words.   Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.   Fortune favours the brave / bold.   God helps those who help themselves.   Good things come to those who wait.   Honesty is the best policy.   Don’t reinvent the wheel.   Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.   If you play with fire, you’ll get burned.   Knowledge is power.   Laughter is the best medicine.   Like father, like son.   Like mother, like daughter.   People who live in the glass houses should not throw stones.   There is no place like home.   There is no such thing as a free lunch. (Nothing is free.)   Time is money.   Two heads are better than one. - It’s easier to do something as a team than by yourself.   Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.   Oil your own machine.   A guilty mind is always suspicious. - A criminal is always weak in mind though he tries to conceal this weakness.   A little learning is a dangerous thing.   A still tongue makes a wise head. - A wise man does not talk very much.   A tree is known by its fruit. - A man’s actual character is known by his actions.   A word to the wise is sufficient. -Wise people do not need long explanation.   Grasp all, lose all   As many men, so many minds   All that glitters is not gold.   An idle brain is the devil’s workshop.   Prevention is better than cure.   As is the tree, so is the fruit.   As you sow so you reap.   Better alone than in bad company.   Better an empty house than an ill tenant.   Civility/courtesy costs nothing   ","categories": ["English"],

        "title": "Which service is using which port?",
        "excerpt":"Every day we fell in some difficulties and want to know which service is using by which port? Ports are divided into three ranges: The well-known ports (from 0 to 1023), the registered ports (from 1024 to 49151) and Dynamic (Private) ports (from 49152 to 65535). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for the global coordination of the port assignment. Here I will show some tools to figure out the problem. Two well-known utility NETSTAT.EXE and TASKLIST.EXE will be used here.   TASKLIST.EXE is used to know the list of processes with its owing id. When we run &gt;tasklist in command window we see the following output.      Suppose, we want to know which port is used by skype? After running »tasklist you will see the above output. Here you will see Image Name: Skype.exe with process id or PID: 3224. Now if you want to know which process owes process id or PID 3224? Just run »tasklist /FI “PID eq 3224”. You will see the following output.      NETSTAT.EXE is used to identify what ports are being used by a particular process. The syntax that we will be using for NETSTAT.EXE is as follows: netstat.exe –a –n –o. Here,   -a: listing of all connections and listening ports -n: display address and port numbers in numerical form -o: display the owning PID associated with each connection Now after running &gt;netstat –a –n –o , you will see the following screen.      If you look at the output, you will see that local address of PID 3224 is 0.0.0.0:55956 which mean process id 3224 used port 55956. You already know that 3224 is the PID of process Skype.exe. So, you came to know that process skype.exe is used port 55956.  ","categories": ["Troubleshooting","OS"],

        "title": "ASP.NET membership step by step",
        "excerpt":"ASP.NET provides build in control to validate and store user credential. So, membership helps to manage user authentication and authorization in website. The membership provider is the glue between Login controls and membership database.   Step 1: Implementing the Membership and Role Provider   Suppose we are going to create a website using Visual Studio 2010. If you create a website using visual studio 2010, you will get login and Registration pages by default. But we want to create it manually so that we can understand its functionality.   So, what should we do? Don’t worry. Let’s create an empty website. To create an empty website, go to Add -&gt; New Website -&gt; ASP.NET Empty Website.   In the empty website, we will get only an web.config file.   To store user information, we need to create required tables, sp and other information into the database in the SQL Server. To create membership tables and stored procedures follow the following steps.      Go to directory C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319   Click aspnet_regsql.exe. You will see the following screen.         Click next to continue         Select Configure SQL Server for application services and Press Next      Type your server name. Here my server name is SOFT. Select SQL Server Authentication, type user name and password of server. Then select Database Name. Click Next to continue. You will see the following screen.      Click Next to continue.      Click Finish. Now all tables and SPs are imported to desired database.   Step 2: Configuring Connection String:   To retrieve membership information, create a connection string. This connection string can be used for retrieving other information from database for the website.     &lt;connectionStrings&gt;     &lt;add name=\"ApplicationServices\" connectionString=\"Data Source=SOFT;Initial Catalog=TourismDB; User ID=sa;Password=sa\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\"/&gt;   &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;   Step 3: Configuring Authentication:   Authentication is the process by which system can identify who are you? ASP.NET framework supports 3 types of Authentication.      Windows Authentication   .NET Passport Authentication   Form Authentication.   We will configure form authentication here. When form authentication is enabled, users are typically identified by the cookies. There are several options for configuring form authentication. One of the options is cookiless which enables you to use form authentication even when the browser does not support cookies.   In this case, Membership handles all details’ of retrieving and storing user and role information. Add the following portion in web.config file to enable form authentication.   &lt;system.web&gt;     &lt;authentication mode=\"Forms\"&gt;       &lt;forms loginUrl=\"~/Account/Login.aspx\" timeout=\"2880\" cookieless=\"AutoDetect\"&gt;       &lt;/forms&gt;     &lt;/authentication&gt;   &lt;/system.web&gt;   Step 4: Membership Provider Settings:   To enable membership, add the following code snippet to web.config file. There are many elements in membership provider. We will use only the important elements here. Basic elements are – name, type( name space of the provider), connectionStringName (name of connection string which is used to connect with membership database). You can use PasswordFormat either of the three – Hash, encrypted and clear. Default value of PasswordFormat attribute is Hashed. You can use maxInvalidPasswordAttempts – number of maximum attempts to enter invalid password,  minRequiredPasswordLength – minimum password length.   &lt;system.web&gt;    &lt;membership&gt;       &lt;providers&gt;         &lt;clear/&gt;              &lt;add name=\"AspNetSqlMembershipProvider\" type=\"System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider\" connectionStringName=\"ApplicationServices\" enablePasswordRetrieval=\"false\" enablePasswordReset=\"true\" requiresQuestionAndAnswer=\"false\" requiresUniqueEmail=\"false\" maxInvalidPasswordAttempts=\"5\" minRequiredPasswordLength=\"6\" minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters=\"0\" passwordAttemptWindow=\"10\" applicationName=\"/\"/&gt;       &lt;providers&gt;     &lt;membership&gt; &lt;system.web&gt;    Step 5: Add a Login Form: Add a login form name Login.aspx in the website. Now add a Login control in Login page. You can change the style of the login control according to your requirements. Elegant format of login control is used here. For the first time, there is no user available. So we must create some users. We used here CreateUserText=”Register” CreateUserUrl=”~/Register.aspx”. This two properties are used here so that we can create a new user by going to Register.aspx page.   &lt;asp:Login ID=\"loginUser\" runat=\"server\" CreateUserText=\"Register\"   CreateUserUrl=\"~/Register.aspx\"   onauthenticate=\"loginUser_Authenticate\" BackColor=\"#F7F7DE\"   BorderColor=\"#CCCC99\" BorderStyle=\"Solid\" BorderWidth=\"1px\"   Font-Names=\"Verdana\" Font-Size=\"10pt\" Height=\"135px\" Width=\"286px\"&gt;   &lt;TitleTextStyle BackColor=\"#6B696B\" Font-Bold=\"True\" ForeColor=\"#FFFFFF\" /&gt; &lt;asp:Login&gt;      Add the following code snippet for handling corresponding onauthenticate event   protected void loginUser_Authenticate(object sender, AuthenticateEventArgs e) {     bool isLogin = Membership.ValidateUser(loginUser.UserName, loginUser.Password);     if (isLogin)     {       loginUser.Visible = true;       Session[\"user\"] = User.Identity.Name;       FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage(loginUser.UserName, true);       Response.Redirect(\"Default.aspx\");     } }   After log in successfully. Page will be redirected to Default.aspx page. So we need to add a Default.aspx page. We will add it later.   Step 6: Add Register Form: In step 5 I have added property CreateUserUrl=”~/Register.aspx” .But this page is not exists. So create a page Register.aspx. In this form we will use a CreateUserWizard which enable to display a user registration form. Like login control you can also change style of CreateUserWizard control. I used here simple format.   &lt;asp:CreateUserWizard ID=\"RegisterUser\" runat=\"server\"             OnCreatedUser=\"RegisterUser_CreatedUser\" BackColor=\"#E3EAEB\"             BorderColor=\"#E6E2D8\" BorderStyle=\"Solid\" BorderWidth=\"1px\"             Font-Names=\"Verdana\" Font-Size=\"0.8em\"&gt;             &lt;ContinueButtonStyle BackColor=\"White\" BorderColor=\"#C5BBAF\"                 BorderStyle=\"Solid\" BorderWidth=\"1px\" Font-Names=\"Verdana\"                 ForeColor=\"#1C5E55\" /&gt;             &lt;CreateUserButtonStyle BackColor=\"White\" BorderColor=\"#C5BBAF\"                 BorderStyle=\"Solid\" BorderWidth=\"1px\" Font-Names=\"Verdana\"                 ForeColor=\"#1C5E55\" /&gt;             &lt;TitleTextStyle BackColor=\"#1C5E55\" Font-Bold=\"True\" ForeColor=\"White\" /&gt;             &lt;WizardSteps&gt;                 &lt;asp:CreateUserWizardStep ID=\"CreateUserWizardStep1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;                 asp:CreateUserWizardStep&gt;                 &lt;asp:CompleteWizardStep ID=\"CompleteWizardStep1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;                 asp:CompleteWizardStep&gt;             WizardSteps&gt;             &lt;HeaderStyle BackColor=\"#666666\" BorderColor=\"#E6E2D8\" BorderStyle=\"Solid\"                 BorderWidth=\"2px\" Font-Bold=\"True\" Font-Size=\"0.9em\" ForeColor=\"White\"                 HorizontalAlign=\"Center\" /&gt;             &lt;NavigationButtonStyle BackColor=\"White\" BorderColor=\"#C5BBAF\"                 BorderStyle=\"Solid\" BorderWidth=\"1px\" Font-Names=\"Verdana\"                 ForeColor=\"#1C5E55\" /&gt;             &lt;SideBarButtonStyle ForeColor=\"White\" /&gt;             &lt;SideBarStyle BackColor=\"#1C5E55\" Font-Size=\"0.9em\" VerticalAlign=\"Top\" /&gt;             &lt;StepStyle BorderWidth=\"0px\" /&gt;         &lt;asp:CreateUserWizard&gt;   Add the following code snippet for handling corresponding OnCreatedUser event.   protected void RegisterUser_CreatedUser(object sender, EventArgs e) {     FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(RegisterUser.UserName, false /* createPersistentCookie */);          string continueUrl = RegisterUser.ContinueDestinationPageUrl;     if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(continueUrl))     {         continueUrl = \"Login.aspx\";     }     Response.Redirect(continueUrl); }   Step 7: Add location tag for Register page: Add the following code snippet in web.config file. This means register page is allowed to all. Because, for the first time you have to create a user without login to the application.   &lt;locationpath=\"Register.aspx\"&gt;   &lt;system.web&gt;     &lt;authorization&gt;       &lt;allowusers=\"*\"/&gt;     &lt;/authorization&gt;   &lt;/system.web&gt; &lt;/location&gt;  Step 8: Add Default Page: Add Default.aspx page. You can add here some message here because page will be redirected to the default page after successfully logged in.   Now run the application. You will see the following login screen.      But you don’t have any user to login. So, click Register in login page and you will be redirected to Register page.      Now create a user and try to login by that user from login page. Yes! you have logged in and redirected to Default.aspx.   Step 9: Add Login Status:  We always see a message “Welcome Mahedee!” after login and Login before login to the site. We see this login status in all pages. If user want to login from any pages, he just need to click in login link and go to login page.  Here he can login and enter the site as authentic user. Here we have created a master page and login status control to do exactly the same thing. Here I used LoginStatus and LoginView Control. It should be mentioned here what are the functions of LoginStatus and LoginView Control? LoginStatus control enables you to display a login or logout link depending on user authentication. It actually displays whether user is currently logged in or not. LoginView enables you to display different content depending on user Authentication status or role.      Add the following code snippet in MasterPage.master.   &lt;asp:LoginView ID=\"HeadLoginView\" runat=\"server\" EnableViewState=\"false\"&gt;     &lt;AnonymousTemplate&gt;         [ &lt;a href=\"Login.aspx\" id=\"HeadLoginStatus\" runat=\"server\"&gt;Log Ina&gt; ]     AnonymousTemplate&gt;     &lt;LoggedInTemplate&gt;         Welcome &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;             &lt;asp:LoginName ID=\"HeadLoginName\" runat=\"server\" /&gt;         span&gt;! [         &lt;asp:LoginStatus ID=\"HeadLoginStatus\" runat=\"server\" LogoutAction=\"Redirect\" LogoutText=\"Log Out\"             LogoutPageUrl=\"~/\" /&gt;         ]     &lt;LoggedInTemplate&gt; &lt;asp:LoginView&gt;   Now if you add MasterPage.master to any of your pages. You will get login status after login to the application. Here I used MasterPage in Default.aspx.   Step 10: Add Role Manager:  To add role manager add the following code snippet to web.config file.   &lt;roleManager enabled=\"true\"&gt;       &lt;providers&gt;         &lt;clear/&gt;         &lt;add name=\"AspNetSqlRoleProvider\" type=\"System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider\" connectionStringName=\"ApplicationServices\" applicationName=\"/\"/&gt;         &lt;add name=\"AspNetWindowsTokenRoleProvider\" type=\"System.Web.Security.WindowsTokenRoleProvider\" applicationName=\"/\"/&gt;       &lt;providers/&gt;     &lt;roleManager/&gt;  Step 11: Create Role Manager Page:   Create a page like below for managing roles.      Step 12: Add Role Provider in web.config:   Add the following code snippet for web.config for enable Role Provider.   &lt;roleManager enabled=\"true\"&gt;       &lt;providers&gt;         &lt;clear/&gt;         &lt;add name=\"AspNetSqlRoleProvider\" type=\"System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider\" connectionStringName=\"ApplicationServices\" applicationName=\"/\"/&gt;         &lt;add name=\"AspNetWindowsTokenRoleProvider\" type=\"System.Web.Security.WindowsTokenRoleProvider\" applicationName=\"/\"/&gt;       &lt;providers/&gt;     &lt;roleManager/&gt;   Step 13: Manage Role:    In step 11 we saw Role manager page. Now we will create the corresponding code for managing (Create, delete roles &amp; assign users to role) roles. Here I also add a grid to display user role mapping.      Create Roles: Add the following code for corresponding event to create role. I have added the code for corresponding Create button event.   protected void btnCreateRole_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     try     {       if (!Roles.RoleExists(this.txtRole.Text))       {         Roles.CreateRole(txtRole.Text);         BindRoles();         BindUsers();         this.lblMsg.Text = \"Role created successfully\";       }       else       {         lblMsg.Text = \"Role already exists\";       }     }     catch (Exception ex)     {       lblMsg.Text = ex.Message;     } }     Bind Roles: I have bind a dropdown list for Roles.   private void BindRoles() {     SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(Convert.ToString(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[\"ApplicationServices\"]));          con.Open();     SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(\"select UserId, UserName from aspnet_users\", con);     DataSet ds = new DataSet();     da.Fill(ds);     this.ddlUsers.DataSource = ds;     ddlUsers.DataTextField = \"UserName\";     ddlUsers.DataValueField = \"UserName\";     ddlUsers.DataBind();          con.Close(); }           Bind Users: A dropdown list is bound for roles in this occasion also. ```csharp private void BindUsers() {   SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(Convert.ToString(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[“ApplicationServices”]));       con.Open();   SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(“SELECT RoleId, RoleName FROM aspnet_Roles”, con);   DataSet ds = new DataSet();   da.Fill(ds);   this.ddlRoles.DataSource = ds;   ddlRoles.DataTextField = “RoleName”;   ddlRoles.DataValueField = “RoleName”;   ddlRoles.DataBind();       con.Close(); }       * Assign Roles to User: Use the following code snippet to assign roles to users.  ```csharp protected void btnAssign_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     try     {       if (!Roles.IsUserInRole(this.ddlRoles.SelectedValue))       {         Roles.AddUserToRole(this.ddlUsers.SelectedValue,this.ddlRoles.SelectedValue);         BindUsers();         BindRoles();         BindUserRole();         this.lblMsg.Text = \"User assigned to role successfully\";       }       else       {         this.lblMsg.Text = \"Role already exits for the user.\";       }     }     catch (Exception ex)     {       this.lblMsg.Text = ex.Message;     } }     Remove role from the user: I have added a gridview in rolemanger page. Here is the code snippet of delete button event handler. Roles.RemoveUserFromRole(string username, string rolename) Method is responsible to remove role form the user.   protected void btnDelete_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     LinkButton btnDelete = sender as LinkButton;          //Identify the clicked row     int rowIndex = Convert.ToInt32(btnDelete.Attributes[\"RowIndex\"]);          GridViewRow gvRow = this.gvRoleToUsers.Rows[rowIndex];          try     {         Roles.RemoveUserFromRole(gvRow.Cells[0].Text, gvRow.Cells[1].Text); //username, role name         BindUsers();         BindRoles();         BindUserRole();         this.lblMsg.Text = \"User is removed from the role\";     }     catch (Exception ex)     {         this.lblMsg.Text = ex.Message;     }   }       Delete roles: The following code snippet is responsible to delete a roles.   protected void btnDeleteRole_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     try     {         Roles.DeleteRole(this.ddlRoles.SelectedValue); //Responsible to delete role         this.BindRoles();         this.BindUserRole();         this.lblMsg.Text = \"Role is deleted!\";     }     catch (Exception exp)     {         this.lblMsg.Text = exp.Message;     } }    Step 14: Show and Hide Menu depending on Roles:   We have already created roles and assigned roles to users. Now if we want to show and Hide the menus depending on roles, we have to follow the following steps.      Add sitemap: Add web.sitemap in the project. We have added this site map with a treeview. Have a look in the web.sitemap content.   &lt;xmlversion=\"1.0\"encoding=\"utf-8\" ?&gt;   &lt;siteMapxmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/AspNet/SiteMap-File-1.0\" &gt;   &lt;siteMapNodeurl=\"ASP.NET\"title=\"\"  description=\"\"roles=\"Administrator\"&gt;   &lt;siteMapNodeurl=\"Defult.aspx\"title=\"Home\"  description=\"\"/&gt;   &lt;siteMapNodeurl=\"Register.aspx\"title=\"Register\"  description=\"\" /&gt;   &lt;siteMapNodeurl=\"RoleManager.aspx\"title=\"Role Manager\"description=\"\"roles=\"Administrator\"/&gt;   &lt;siteMapNodeurl=\"ManageUsers.aspx\"title=\"User Manager\"description=\"\"roles=\"Administrator,IT officer\"/&gt;   &lt;siteMapNode/&gt;   &lt;siteMap/&gt;   You may understand above code snippet that only Administrator can view RoleManager.aspx page and Administrator and IT Officer can view ManageUsers.aspx page. There is no restriction in other pages.      Add Location element in web.config: To hide and show menu as described above add the following code snippet in web.config file.   &lt;locationpath=\"RoleManager.aspx\"&gt;   &lt;system.web&gt;     &lt;authorization&gt;     &lt;allowroles=\"Administrator\"/&gt;     &lt;denyusers=\"*\"/&gt;     &lt;authorization/&gt;   &lt;system.web/&gt; &lt;location/&gt; &lt;locationpath=\"ManageUsers.aspx\"&gt;   &lt;system.web&gt;     &lt;authorization&gt;     &lt;allowroles=\"Administrator,IT officer\"/&gt;     &lt;denyusers=\"*\"/&gt;     &lt;authorization&gt;   &lt;system.web/&gt; &lt;location/&gt;   Ok now run your application. Login to the application and you will see menus according to your roles.    ","categories": ["ASP.NET","C#"],

        "title": "Abstract class and method using C# – A detail description",
        "excerpt":"What is Abstract Class?   Abstract class is a class that has no direct instances, but its descendants may have direct instances.  An abstract class is a class that can contain abstract members, although it is not required. But any class that contains abstract member must be abstract. An abstract class can also contain non-abstract members.   An abstract method is an empty method – a method that has no implementation. Any class that implement this abstract class must implement the abstract method. We always use interface in C#, it is implicitly abstract.   Why abstract class?   The purpose of an abstract class is to act as a base class. It is not possible to instantiate an abstract class directly, nor can an abstract class be sealed. Often we need a class that contains methods that must be implemented by all derived classes but not by the base class itself. By this, actually we force the programmer to implement base class methods. Think a simple scenario. Suppose we want to develop a banking software. Here a common entity is account information. There are many type of account like savings account,  current account e.t.c in bank. In every account two things is common that is deposit and withdraw. So we can create a Account class as base class which must have this two method deposit and withdraw and it will be abstract method and the Account class will be abstract class. So, you can say – why its will be abstract class and abstract method? Answer of the first question is if there is any abstract member in the class, the class must be abstract. Answer of the second question, in every type of accounts two things is common deposit and withdraw but their way of transaction may be different. We just want to enforce the programmer to implement the methods if the create any class by inheriting the Account class   Syntax   The syntax for creating an abstract method is - use the abstract modifier with the name of the method and the parameters, followed by a semicolon by keeping it empty. It will be look like this.   [access-modifiers] abstract return-type method-name ([parameters]) ;   Example:   The following example shows how to create an abstract class Account with two abstract methods Deposit and Withdraw.   public abstract class Account {     public abstract string Deposit(double money);     public abstract string Withdraw(double money); }   The benefit of creating abstract methods is that it enables you to add methods to your base class that subsequently must be implemented by all derived classes, but the implementation details for these methods do not have to be defined in the base class.   Override the abstract class  When a derived class inherits an abstract method from an abstract class, it must override the abstract methods. This requirement is enforced at compile time. The following example shows how a SavingsAccount class, which is derived from Account, uses the override keyword to implement the Deposit and Withdraw method. Here first (Account) class is base class and second (SavingsAccount) is derived class.   /// /// Base class /// public abstract class Account {     public abstract string Deposit(double money);     public abstract string Withdraw(double money); }   /// /// Derived class /// public class SavingsAccount : Account {       //override the base class     public override string Deposit(double money)     {         return \"AC type savings: Deposit transaction done sucessfully\";     }          public override string Withdraw(double money)     {         return \"AC type savings: Withdraw transaction done sucessfully\";     } }   After creating instance of SavingsAccount, if you call Deposit and withdraw method you will see the following output:   AC type savings: Deposit transaction done sucessfully AC type savings: Withdraw transaction done sucessfully   Abstract class with virtual method:   You can also create an abstract class that contains virtual methods, as shown in the following example:   /// /// Base class ///   public abstract class Account {     public virtual void BankName()     {         Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to ABC Bank Limited\");     }          public abstract string Deposit(double money);     public abstract string Withdraw(double money); }    In this case, a derived class does not have to provide an implementation of the BankName method because BankName is defined as virtual. Therefore, I say the important thing again, if you have a generic method that is common to all derived classes, and you want to force each derived class to implement the method, you must define the method as abstract in the base class.   Difference between an abstract method &amp; virtual method:   Virtual method has an implementation and provides the derived class with the option of overriding it. Abstract method does not provide an implementation and forces the derived class to override the method.   Abstract Properties:   Properties may also be declared as abstract. Same as abstract method, to declare an abstract property, specify the property name and the accessors that the derived property should implement.   Example:   /// /// Base class /// public abstract class Account {     //Abastract property     public abstract string AccountNo { get; set; }          //Virtual Method     public virtual void BankName()     {         Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to ABC Bank Limited\");     }          public abstract string Deposit(double money);     public abstract string Withdraw(double money); }   Total Solution:   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   /* * Author : Md.

Contains abstract methods that must be implemented by the derived class.   Cannot create instance of abstract class.   Abstract class can contain no abstract members.    ","categories": ["OOP","C#"],

        "excerpt":"GridView is a powerful control of ASP.net. Here I tried to demonstrate gridview with a simple project. I have stored employee information then displayed it in gridview and insert, update and delete employee information.   Step 1: Create a table name hrm_employee and insert some sample data in it.   --Create Table : hrm_employee--- CREATE TABLE hrm_employee (   emp_gid INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,   emp_fullnm VARCHAR(100),   emp_nicknm VARCHAR(50),   emp_designation VARCHAR(100) )   ---Insert data ito table: hrm_employee----   -- Insert data i.e. row-1 --- INSERT INTO hrm_employee (   emp_fullnm   , emp_nicknm   , emp_designation ) VALUES (     'Md.

Khondakar Enamul Haque'   , 'Rony'   , 'Broadcast Engineer' )    Step 2: Create an ASP.net website with 3 Layers - DAL for data access layer, BLL for Business Logic Layer and presentation Layer. Also create another layer name Model for mapping with data.   Step 3: Create connection string in web.config file.   &lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name=\"SQLServerConnectionString\" connectionString=\"Data Source=SOFT;Initial   Catalog=TestDB;User ID=sa;Password=sa\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\"/&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;  Step 4: Create Images Folder and store icon edit_icon.gif for edit and icon_remove.png for delete.

        "title": "Introduction to Web Services using ASP.NET",
        "excerpt":"What is Web Services?   Web service is a method of communication between two web based application using XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI open standards over an internet protocol backbone. Web service can convert your application into web application which can publish its function or message to the rest of the world. Web service are-      Web services are application components   Web services communicate with open protocols   Web services are self-contained and self-describing   Web services can be discovered using UDDI (*4)   Web services can be used by other applications   XML is the basis of web services   Why Web Services?   Different web applications in the web want to interact with each other. Such as application can share data, can invoke method of other application. So, how can you solve this? It will also be a great problem if applications are in different platform and language. Web service solves the above issues.   By using Web services, your application can publish its function or message to the rest of the world. Web services use XML to code and to decode data, and SOAP to transport it (using open protocols). With Web services, your accounting department’s Win 2k server’s billing system can connect with your IT supplier’s UNIX server   Web services have two types of uses:      Reusable Application Component - currency conversion, weather reports, language translation.   Connect Existing Software - Web services can help to solve the interoperability problem by giving different applications a way to link their data.   How does it work?   The basic web service platform is XML + HTTP. Web service elements are –      SOAP – Simple Object Access Protocol   UDDI – Universal Description, Discovery and Integration   WSDL – Web Service Description Language   With ASP.net, you do not have to write SOAP and WSDL documents. ASP.net automatically creates SOAP and WSDL documents.   Example:   Simple Addition Method: Here I have tried to represent web service before you by a simple add method which takes two parameter as two integer value and it returns the addition of these two.   Step 1: Create Asp.net Web service      Create an Asp.net website.   Click right button on asp.net web site.   Click on add new Item.   Select Web service like and click add button   Right click on WebService.asmx and select view code. You will see the following code snippet. It should be mentioned here that I have created my web service named WebService which you have already seen in previous screen.   using System;  using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.Services;   /// /// Summary description for WebService ///   [WebService(Namespace = \"http://tempuri.org/\")] [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]   // To allow this Web Service to be called from script, using ASP.NET AJAX, uncomment the following line. // [System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService]   public class WebService : System.Web.Services.WebService  {     public WebService ()      {        //Uncomment the following line if using designed components     //InitializeComponent();     }          [WebMethod]     public string HelloWorld()     {         return \"Hello World\";     }   }     Simply add a Method name Add as like below.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.Services;   /// /// Summary description for WebService ///   [WebService(Namespace = \"http://tempuri.org/\")] [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]   // To allow this Web Service to be called from script, using ASP.NET AJAX, uncomment the following line.   // [System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService]   public class WebService : System.Web.Services.WebService  {     public WebService ()      {           //Uncomment the following line if using designed components       //InitializeComponent();     }          [WebMethod]     public string HelloWorld()     {         return \"Hello World\";     }          [WebMethod]     public int Add(int firstVal, int secondVal)     {         return firstVal + secondVal;     }  }       Click right button on WebService.asmx and set as Start Page   Run Project or press F5.   Click Add method, you will see a page with two text field name firstVal and secondVal.   Suppose, I input two value 12 and 30. Click Invoke.   After clicking Invoke you will get the addition of two values as XML format.   Now your web service is ready to use. We have to use web service in various ways. In the next step I will show how to access web service from client page.   Step 2: Create a client page and access web service.   There are many ways to consume web service. Here is an example of HTML-POST protocol which is one of the ways of consuming web service.      Create a aspx/html page. I have used here an aspx page name “ClientForm.aspx”.   Add the following tags in aspx source.   In action attribute of form tag, I have used localhost because I have already hosted it. You can simply use “http://localhost:5143/Web/WebService.asmx/Add” in  action attribute instead of present value in action attribute if you didn’t host website in your local machine. Here 5143 can vary.   &lt;form id=\"form1\" action=\"http://localhost/Demo_2010/WebService.asmx/Add\"&gt;   &lt;div&gt;     Input1: &lt;input name=\"firstVal\" type=\"text\" /&gt;      Input2: &lt;input name=\"secondVal\" type=\"text\" /&gt;      &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Enter\" /&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt;     Click right button on ClientForm.aspx and set as Start Up page.   Run your project.   You will see a screen with two textbox   Enter two values of two textbox.   Press Enter you will get the result in xml format.   This is the basic example and web service. You will see more about web service next.   Notes:   XML provides a language which can be used between different platforms and programming languages and still express complex messages and functions.   SOAP: The HTTP protocol is the most used Internet protocol. SOAP is an XML-based protocol to let applications exchange information over HTTP. Or, more simple: SOAP is a protocol for accessing a Web Service.      SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol   SOAP is a communication protocol   SOAP is a format for sending messages   SOAP is designed to communicate via Internet   SOAP is platform independent   SOAP is language independent   SOAP is based on XML   SOAP is simple and extensible   SOAP allows you to get around firewalls   SOAP is a W3C standard   WSDL:  WSDL is an XML-based language for locating and describing Web services.      WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language   WSDL is based on XML   WSDL is used to describe Web services   WSDL is used to locate Web services   WSDL is a W3C standard   UDDI:     UDDI is a directory service where companies can register and search for Web services.   UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration   UDDI is a directory for storing information about web services   UDDI is a directory of web service interfaces described by WSDL   UDDI communicates via SOAP   UDDI is built into the Microsoft .NET platform    ","categories": ["ASP.NET","C#"],

        "title": "Recovering SQL Server Database From Suspect Mode",
        "excerpt":"Sometimes we have to face a critical situation when SQL Server database going to Suspect Mode. In that moment no work can be done on database. Database may go into suspect mode because the primary file group is damaged and the database cannot be recovered during the startup of the SQL Server   Reason for database to go into suspect mode:     Data files or log files are corrupt.   Database server was shut down improperly   Lack of Disk Space   SQL cannot complete a rollback or roll forward operation.   How to recover database from suspect mode:   Step 1: Change the status of your database. Suppose database name is “BluechipDB”   EXEC sp_resetstatus '';   Example:   EXEC sp_resetstatus 'BlueChipDB'   Step 2: Set the database in “Emergency” mode   ALTER DATABASE  SET EMERGENCY;  Example:   ALTER DATABASE BlueChipDB SET EMERGENCY  Step 3: Check the database for any inconsistency   DBCC CHECKDB('');  Example:   DBCC checkdb('BlueChipDB')  Step 4: If you get any error after executing DBCC CHECKDB then immediately bring the database in SINGLE USER MODE by running following query. If no error found then you need not execute the following query.   ALTER DATABASE  SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE   Example:  ALTER DATABASE BlueChipDB SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE   Step 5: For safety, take the backup of the database.   Step 6: Run the following query as next step. Remember while using the below query, that uses REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS, is a one way operation that is once the database is repaired all the actions performed by these queries can’t be undone. There is no way to go back to the previous state of the database. So as a precautionary step you should take backup of your database in step 5 mentioned above.   DBCC CHECKDB ('', REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS);  Example  DBCC CheckDB ('BlueChipDB', REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS)   Step 7: Finally, bring the database in MULTI USER mode   ALTER DATABASE  SET MULTI_USER; ALTER DATABASE [BlueChipDB]  SET MULTI_USER  Step 8: Refresh your database server and verify the connectivity of your database. Now users should be able to connect to the database properly. If any data loss, you can restore database – backup taken in step 5.    ","categories": ["SQL Server","Database","Troubleshooting"],

        "title": "Configure Web gardens in IIS 7 step by step",
        "excerpt":"Introduction  “Web garden” scaling out by increasing the number of worker processes per CPU. Web gardening will allow more than two subscribers to synchronize at the same time. Before going to the details of web garden, I hope you have fundamental idea on application pool and worker process. Just for reminder - for request processing in IIS, worker process (w3wp.exe) runs the ASP.NET application in IIS. Worker process is responsible for handling all kinds of request, response, session data, and cache data. Application Pool is the container of worker process. Application pool is used to separate sets of IIS worker processes and enables a better security, reliability, and availability for any web application. It will also increase CPU utilization by replisapi.dll, which can negatively impact overall server performance. So, it is important to balance these considerations when you choose a value for Maximum Worker Processes.      Fig – Application pool is the container of one or more worker processes   Now, by default, each and every Application pool contains a single worker process. Application which contains the multiple worker process is called “Web Garden”. Below is the typical diagram for a web garden application.      Fig – Multiple worker process in an application pool (Web garden)   Why Web garden?     Offering applications that are not CPU-bound but execute long running requests the ability to scale and not use up all threads available in the worker process   Applications that make long running database requests (e.g. high computational database transaction)   Applications that have threads occupied by long-running synchronous and network intensive transactions   You can support a greater number of concurrent synchronization operations per CPU by increasing the Maximum Worker Process property value   Provides better application availability by sharing request between multiple worker processes.   Web garden use processor affinity where application can swapped out based on preference and tag setting.   Less consumption of physical space for web garden configuration.   Configure Web garden in IIS 7   Step 1: Deploy and configure your web application as usual   Step 2: Modify web.config file   Find out the following line in web.config file.  &lt;sessionState mode=\"InProc\" timeout=\"60\"&gt;&lt;/sessionState&gt;   If the above line exists, remove the above line and replace following line.   &lt;sessionState mode=\"StateServer\" cookieless=\"false\" timeout=\"30\" stateConnectionString=\"tcpip=127.0.0.1:42424\" /&gt;   Here tcpip = “127.0.0.1” is local state server IP and “42424” is the port number for state server.  You can use other IP as state server.   Step 3:  Modify registry by regedit   Run -&gt; regedt -&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEM -&gt; CurrentControlSet -&gt; Services -&gt; aspnet_state -&gt; Parameters      Step a: AllowRemoteConnection (Right Click) -&gt; Modify -&gt; Set Value Data to 1 (Base Decimal) -&gt; Ok   Step b: Port (Right Click) -&gt; Modify -&gt; Base Decimal -&gt; Ok   Step 4: Run asp.net state service   Check the following step: Run -&gt; control -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Services -&gt; ASP.NET State Service (Right Click) -&gt; Properties     Step a:  Startup Type -&gt; Automatic   Step b:  Service Status -&gt; start   Finally Click Ok.   Step 5: Create an application pool  Create a different application pool for safety. If you use a separate application pool, it will be easy to manage. You can use default application pool also.   To create an application pool that runs using a custom service account     Start Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.  (Run-&gt;inetmgr)   In the left pane, expand the local computer and then select Application Pools.   Right-click the Application Pools node, clicks Add Application Pool, and then clicks Application Pool.        In the Add Application Pool dialog box, type “Pool Name” in the name text box. In figure Pool name is Bluechipplus. Select .NET Framework version. In figure, I select 4.0.30319. Select Managed pipeline mode. I select integrated mode. Selection of framework version and managed pipeline mode depends on your application which you are going to hosted. Click OK to complete application pool creation.              Now select application pools. You will see newly created Bluechipplus application pool in the middle panel.   Step 6: Configure application pool     Select newly created “Bluechipplus” application pool in the middle panel.   Click Advanced Settings in “Edit Application Pool” section in the right panel. A dialogue box will appear named “Advanced Settings”   In Process Model section, select identity. Network service is default and recommended. If you find problem, you should change. In figure Local service is selected.   In Process Model section, type maximum worker process. In figure 12 maximum worker processes selected. Selecting worker process is actually depends on your server capability and memory.   In Recycling section, select private memory limit in KB. In figure 200000 is selected. Consider your server memory before considering memory limit.        Finally click OK to complete application pool settings.              Step 7: Select application pool for the application     Right click on application in IIS-&gt;Manage Application -&gt; Advanced Settings         From advanced settings dialogue box -&gt; Browse application pool -&gt; Select application pool         Finally click OK after assigning application pool   Now you have completed web garden for your application. Browse your application and cheers!!!    ","categories": ["IIS","ASP.NET","Troubleshooting"],

        "title": "SQL Join With Microsoft SQL Server",
        "excerpt":"What is SQL Joins?   In SQL, a join is a mechanism to combine data from two or more tables based on related columns between them. A join allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables as a single result set.   There are several types of joins in SQL, including:     INNER JOIN   LEFT JOIN   RIGHT JOIN   FULL JOIN   SELF JOIN   CARTESIAN JOIN/CROSS JOIN   To understand JOINs, let’s consider the following two tables Customers and Orders is as follows   Customers      Orders      INNER JOIN   INNER JOIN returns match data between tables. It returns rows when there is at least one match in both the tables.      Syntax:   SELECT Cust.Id, Cust.Name, ord.Amount, ord.[Date] FROM Customers Cust INNER JOIN Orders ord ON Cust.Id = ord.CustomerId;   Output:                  ID       Name       Amount       Date                       2       Hamidur Rahman       4000.00       2014-01-10                 2       Hamidur Rahman       5000.00       2014-01-10                 3       Jamilur Rahman       3000.00       2014-02-13                 4       Hasan Sarwar       600.00       2014-03-22           LEFT JOIN/LEFT OUTER JOIN  Left Outer Join returns all the rows from the left table in conjunction with the matching rows from the right table. If there are no columns matching in the right table, it returns NULL values.      SELECT Cust.Id, Cust.Name, ord.Amount, ord.[Date] FROM Customers Cust LEFT JOIN Orders ord ON Cust.Id = ord.CustomerId;   Output:                  Id       Name       Amount       Date                       1       Mahedee Hasan       NULL       NULL                 2       Hamidur Rahman       4000.00       2014-01-10                 2       Hamidur Rahman       5000.00       2014-01-10                 3       Jamilur Rahman       3000.00       2014-02-13                 4       Hasan Sarwar       600.00       2014-03-22                 5       Kamal Hossain       NULL       NULL                 6       Imran Khan       NULL       NULL                 7       Abu Sayem       NULL       NULL           RIGHT JOIN/RIGHT OUTER JOIN  Right outer join returns all the rows from the right table in conjunction with the matching rows from the left table. If there are no columns matching in the left table, it returns NULL values.      Syntax:   SELECT Cust.Id, Cust.Name, ord.Amount, ord.[Date] FROM Customers Cust RIGHT JOIN Orders ord ON Cust.Id = ord.CustomerId;   Output:                  Id       Name       Amount       Date                       2       Hamidur Rahman       4000.00       2014-01-10                 2       Hamidur Rahman       5000.00       2014-01-10                 3       Jamilur Rahman       3000.00       2014-02-13                 4       Hasan Sarwar       600.00       2014-03-22                 NULL       NULL       800.00       2014-03-22           FULL JOIN /FULL OUTER JOIN   Full outer join is combines left outer join and right outer join. It returns row from either table when the conditions are met and returns null value when there is no match      Syntax:   SELECT Cust.Id, Cust.Name, ord.Amount, ord.[Date] FROM Customers Cust FULL JOIN Orders ord ON Cust.Id = ord.CustomerId;   Output:                  Id       Name       Amount       Date                       1       Mahedee Hasan       NULL       NULL                 2       Hamidur Rahman       4000.00       2014-01-10                 2       Hamidur Rahman       5000.00       2014-01-10                 3       Jamilur Rahman       3000.00       2014-02-13                 4       Hasan Sarwar       600.00       2014-03-22                 5       Kamal Hossain       NULL       NULL                 6       Imran Khan       NULL       NULL                 7       Abu Sayem       NULL       NULL                 NULL       NULL       800.00       2014-03-22           SELF JOIN  The SQL SELF JOIN is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.   Syntax:   SELECT A.Id, A.Name, B.Name AS Introducer FROM Customers A, Customers B WHERE A.IntroducerId = B.Id   Output:                  Id       Name       Introducer                       1       Mahedee Hasan       Hamidur Rahman                 2       Hamidur Rahman       Mahedee Hasan                 3       Jamilur Rahman       Hamidur Rahman                 4       Hasan Sarwar       Jamilur Rahman                 5       Kamal Hossain       Hasan Sarwar                 6       Imran Khan       Kamal Hossain                 7       Abu Sayem       Imran Khan           CARTESIAN JOIN/CROSS JOIN  The SQL cross join produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table, if no WHERE clause uses in the second table      Syntax:   SELECT cust.Id, cust.Name, ord.Amount, ord.[Date] FROM Customers cust CROSS JOIN Orders ord   Output:                  Id       Name       Amount       Date                       1       Mahedee Hasan       4000.00       2014-01-10                 2       Hamidur Rahman       4000.00       2014-01-10                 3       Jamilur Rahman       4000.00       2014-01-10                 4       Hasan Sarwar       4000.00       2014-01-10                 5       Kamal Hossain       4000.00       2014-01-10                 6       Imran Khan       4000.00       2014-01-10                 7       Abu Sayem       4000.00       2014-01-10                 1       Mahedee Hasan       5000.00       2014-01-10                 2       Hamidur Rahman       5000.00       2014-01-10                 3       Jamilur Rahman       5000.00       2014-01-10                 4       Hasan Sarwar       5000.00       2014-01-10                 5       Kamal Hossain       5000.00       2014-01-10                 6       Imran Khan       5000.00       2014-01-10                 7       Abu Sayem       5000.00       2014-01-10                 1       Mahedee Hasan       3000.00       2014-02-13                 2       Hamidur Rahman       3000.00       2014-02-13                 3       Jamilur Rahman       3000.00       2014-02-13                 4       Hasan Sarwar       3000.00       2014-02-13                 5       Kamal Hossain       3000.00       2014-02-13                 6       Imran Khan       3000.00       2014-02-13                 7       Abu Sayem       3000.00       2014-02-13                 1       Mahedee Hasan       600.00       2014-03-22                 2       Hamidur Rahman       600.00       2014-03-22                 3       Jamilur Rahman       600.00       2014-03-22                 4       Hasan Sarwar       600.00       2014-03-22                 5       Kamal Hossain       600.00       2014-03-22                 6       Imran Khan       600.00       2014-03-22                 7       Abu Sayem       600.00       2014-03-22                 1       Mahedee Hasan       800.00       2014-03-22                 2       Hamidur Rahman       800.00       2014-03-22                 3       Jamilur Rahman       800.00       2014-03-22                 4       Hasan Sarwar       800.00       2014-03-22                 5       Kamal Hossain       800.00       2014-03-22                 6       Imran Khan       800.00       2014-03-22                 7       Abu Sayem       800.00       2014-03-22           Additional Information Related JOIN   Left Outer Join Where Null Left outer join where null returns all the rows from the left table in conjunction without the matching rows from the right table.

        "title": "Introduction To ASP.NET MVC",
        "excerpt":"What is MVC?   MVC is a framework methodology. It divides an application’s implementation into three component roles: models, views, and controllers.         The Model represents the application core (for instance a list of database records).   The View displays the data (the database records).   The Controller handles the input.   For example: If you request a page, first controller handle the request and order a action which will serve the request. Action can use model to get database record. Then action displays results to the view pages. MVC provides full control over HTML, CSS and JavaScript.   You can think MVC model defines web applications with 3 logic layers:      The business layer (Model logic)   The display layer (View logic)   The input control (Controller logic)   The Model is the part of the application that handles the logic for the application data. Often model objects retrieve data (and store data) from a database.   The View is the parts of the application that handles the display of the data. Most often the views are created from the model data.   The Controller is the part of the application that handles user interaction. Typically controllers read data from a view, control user input, and send input data to the model.   The MVC separation helps you manage complex applications, because you can focus on one aspect a time. For example, you can focus on the view without depending on the business logic. It also makes it easier to test an application.   The MVC separation also simplifies group development. Different developers can work on the view, the controller logic, and the business logic in parallel.   A Look at MVC Request Response process   From the above discussion, you may guess the Request Response process of MVC. Let us try to see this formally.      User sends the request by the URL.   UrlRoutingModule intercepts the request and starts parsing it.   The appropriate Controller and handler will be identified from the URL by looking at the RouteTable collection. Also any data coming along with the request is kept in RouteData.   The appropriate action in the identified controller will be executed.   This action will create the Model class based on data.   The action will then pass on this created model class to some view and tell the view to proceed.   Now the view will execute and create the markup based on the logic and Model’s data and then push the HTML back to the browser.   This life cycle above is defined for explanation and has omitted some technical details.   What is View Engine?   View Engines are responsible for rendering the HTML from your views to the browser. The view engine template will have different syntax for implementation. Currently there are few numbers of view engines available for MVC and the top four view engines are Razor, traditional ASPX, Spark and NHaml.  ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","C#"],

        "excerpt":"In my series tutorial on ASP.NET MVC, I will try to develop an application which is called Training Management System (TMS). In this project, I will keep an employee’s skill matrix on the basis of training. Rather than this, I will keep employee information, training information and many more. I will continuously modify the project by implementing different features and functionality of ASP.NET MVC.   In this article, I will show how to implement a simple model and ViewBag. ASP.NET MVC offers us ViewBag for passing data from controller to view. ViewBag is dynamic object. Let’s create a project using asp.net MVC.   Step 1: Create a Model name – AboutModel   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web;   namespace TMS.Models {   public class AboutModel   {     public string Name { get; set; }     public string Location { get; set; }   } }   Step 2: Edit HomeController and update the About action as follows   public ActionResult About() {   ViewBag.Message = \"Company Information\";      var aboutModel = new AboutModel();   aboutModel.Name = \"Leadsoft Bangladesh Limited\";   aboutModel.Location = \"41/6, Purana Platan, Sawdesh Tower, Dhaka - 1000\";      return View(aboutModel); }   In this action, you will see, ViewBag.Message is used to hold a string, we will use it in view. I use a AboutModel object name aboutModel with its two property which will also use in the view.   Step 3: Edit About view (About.cshtml) as follows   @model TMS.Models.AboutModel @{ ViewBag.Title = \"About\"; } &lt;hgroupclass=\"title\"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;@ViewBag.Title.&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/hgroup&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;@ViewBag.Message&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;@Model.Name&lt;/h2&gt; Location : @Model.Location &lt;/div&gt;   Add @model TMS.Models.AboutModelat the top of the view. To view the ViewBag data use like @ViewBag.Message . Use AboutModel value like   &lt;h2&gt;@Model.Name&lt;/h2&gt; Location : @Model.Location   Now run the project and click About link, you will see the output.      ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","C#"],

        "excerpt":"Let’s consider a url http://localhost/home/about . How does it work in an MVC application? How does it deliver a request? Yes, routing engine is responsible for this task. So, what is routing engine? The routing engine is a core part of asp.net. It’s not tied to the MVC framework. You can use the routing engine to route requests for web form, WCF Service, actually any type of resources but in MVC we use this routing engine to direct requests to our controllers.      The goal of the routing engine, its job is to examine a URL and figure out where to send it for processing.   Let’s examine our TMS application (according to our previous article) or any other ASP.NET MVC application. If you open global.asax file of TMS, you can see a class here derived from HttpApplication and this allow to hook into some application level events like application start. This method(application_start) magically invoked by asp.net before processing the first http request. So when your application starts, application_start will execute one time before any of your controllers start executing. Here is the sample global.asax file.   public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication {     protected void Application_Start()     {         AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();         WebApiConfig.Register(GlobalConfiguration.Configuration);         FilterConfig.RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilters.Filters);                  RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes); //Responsible for routing                  BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(BundleTable.Bundles);         AuthConfig.RegisterAuth();          } }  In Application_Start() method the following statement is responsible for routing. RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);   If you click right button on “RegisterRoutes” and go to definition it will go to the RegisterRoutes method of the RouteConfig class which is App_Start folder. Here is the RouteConfig class. I can get into the definition of this method if I just put my cursor tight here on the method and press F12.   You have noticed that this class is called from the application start method in globa.asax.cs.   public class RouteConfig {     public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)     {         routes.IgnoreRoute(\"{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}\");         routes.MapRoute(         name: \"Default\", //Route Name         url: \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\", //URL with parameters (Pattern for the route)         defaults: new { controller = \"Home\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional } //Default route             );              } }    So, let me introduce details of the RegisterRoutes method. Here is the code we see, here the first statement is  routes.IgnoreRoute(\"{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}\");  It means ignore route which is in this pattern. Then let’s see the following statement. It means add a new route name “Default” and routing pattern must be “{controller}/{action}/{id}” and default routing   routes.MapRoute( name: \"Default\", //Route Name url: \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\", //URL with parameters (Pattern for the rout) defaults: new { controller = \"Home\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional } //Default route );   Defaults route means, when you don’t type any controller or action in the URL, its goes to the index action of home controller.   Let’s go to the index action of home controller and modify the index action like following.   public ActionResult Index() { var controller = RouteData.Values[\"controller\"]; var action = RouteData.Values[\"action\"]; var id = RouteData.Values[\"id\"];   var message = string.Format(\"{0}::{1} {2}\",controller, action,id);   ViewBag.Message = message;   return View(); }    Now if you run the application you will see in the home page – Home::Index If you slightly modify the url like - http://localhost:25379/Home/Index/2323. You will see home page - Home::Index 2323 Now you understand what the function of route and controller is? Happy programming !!! 🙂      ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","C#"],

        "title": "A Simple Application With ASP.NET MVC 4 With EF 6 Code First And Scaffolding",
        "excerpt":"Introduction  Before going to the details of article, I think you already know what MVC is and how ASP.NET MVC Works. If you don’t have any idea, you are requested to read the following article.      Introduction to ASP.NET MVC   How to create first Application by ASP.NET MVC   Uses of ViewBag and Model in ASP.NET MVC   Routes and Controllers in ASP.NET MVC   Project description  In this article I will develop a simple application with ASP.NET MVC 4 with Entity Framework 6 code first approach and scaffolding. I will also use MvcScaffold for quick develop of controllers, context and views. For your kind information, here I used visual studio 2012. Here I will develop two functionalities of an application “Training Management system” – Trainer Information and Training Information. User can view, save, edit and delete Trainer information and training information can be viewed, saved, edit and deleted same way. Both trainer and training information will show in simple grid. Trainer can be assigned to the training information   Entity Framework – code first  Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.   Three approach of entity framework are Model first, Database first, code first. In Code-First Approach, we create the classes first and then generate the database from the classes directly   Application development step by step   Step 1: Create a simple application name “TMS” by asp.net mvc.   I think, you must know How to create first Application by ASP.NET MVC) .   Step 2: Install “nuget” packages.     For installing “nuget”, you must have enable internet connection.   Open Package Manager Console (Tools-&gt; Library Package Manager –&gt; Package Manager Console)   Run following commands in the console – bottom of the window.   PM&gt;Install-Package EntityFramework  PM&gt;Install-Package MvcScaffolding   Step 3: Create two models “Trainer” and “Training” in Model folder.      Create Trainer and Training model class in Models folder.   Trainer.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema; using System.Linq; using System.Web;   namespace TMS.Models {     public class Trainer     {              [Required, Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public long Id { get; set; }          public string Name { get; set; }          public string Designation { get; set; }         public string Oranizaton { get; set; }          public DateTime CreateDate { get; set; }         public DateTime ModificationDate { get; set; }          public bool IsActive { get; set; }     } }   Training.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema; using System.Linq; using System.Web;   namespace TMS.Models {     public class Training     {         [Required, Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]                  public long Id { get; set; }         public string Title { get; set; }         public string Venue { get; set; }         public long TrainerId { get; set; }                  [ForeignKey(\"TrainerId\")]         public virtual Trainer Trainer { get; set; }                  public string Description { get; set; }                  public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }         public DateTime EndDate { get; set; }                  public DateTime CreateDate { get; set; }         public DateTime ModificationDate { get; set; }                  public bool IsActive { get; set; }     } }    In the above model, I used  [Required, Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]   Which means attribute “Id” of the model is primary key and it is a identity column.   [ForeignKey(“TrainerId”)] means TrainerId is a Foreign key of Trainer. This two are called data annotation. You will know more about data annotation. I will write another article on data annotation soon.   Step 4: Change Connection String   Create a database name “TMSDB” and change connection string like following   &lt;add name=\"TMSContext\" connectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=TMSDB;Integrated Security=SSPI;\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt;   Step 5: Create Controller and View using “Scaffold”     Open Package Manager Console (Tools-&gt; Library Package Manager –&gt; Package Manager Console)   Type the following command to Package Manager Console.   PM&gt; Scaffold Controller Trainer PM&gt; Scaffold Controller Training   After running the above command, TrainersController, TrainingController and their corresponding view will be created.   Step 6: Modify Contex and Layout.      Modify TMSContext.cs file like following   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Data.Entity; using System.Linq; using System.Web;   namespace TMS.Models {     public class TMSContext : DbContext     {         // You can add custom code to this file. Changes will not be overwritten.         //         // If you want Entity Framework to drop and regenerate your database         // automatically whenever you change your model schema, add the following         // code to the Application_Start method in your Global.asax file.         // Note: this will destroy and re-create your database with every model change.         //         // System.Data.Entity.Database.SetInitializer(new System.Data.Entity.DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges());                  //Added for customized connection string \"TMSContext\"         public TMSContext()         : base(\"TMSContext\")         {         }                  public DbSet UserProfiles { get; set; } //Added DbSet                  public DbSet Trainers { get; set; } //Auto generated by scaffolding                  public DbSet Trainings { get; set; } //Auto generated by scaffolding     } }    Build the application you will find error. So, replace UsersContext by TMSContext and build again. Now it builds successfully.   Added the marked two line in the _Layout.cshtml page (Views-&gt;Shared-&gt;_Layout.cshtml)   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;     &lt;head&gt;         &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;         &lt;title&gt;@ViewBag.Title - My ASP.NET MVC Application&lt;/title&gt;         &lt;link href=\"~/favicon.ico\" rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" /&gt;         &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" /&gt;         @Styles.Render(\"~/Content/css\")         @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/modernizr\")     &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;         &lt;header&gt;             &lt;div class=\"content-wrapper\"&gt;                 &lt;div class=\"float-left\"&gt;                     &lt;p class=\"site-title\"&gt;@Html.ActionLink(\"your logo here\", \"Index\", \"Home\")&lt;/p&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;                 &lt;div class=\"float-right\"&gt;                     &lt;section id=\"login\"&gt;                         @Html.Partial(\"_LoginPartial\")                     &lt;/section&gt;                     &lt;nav&gt;                         &lt;ul id=\"menu\"&gt;                             &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(\"Home\", \"Index\", \"Home\")&lt;/li&gt;                             &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(\"About\", \"About\", \"Home\")&lt;/li&gt;                             &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(\"Contact\", \"Contact\", \"Home\")&lt;/li&gt;                                                          &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(\"Trainer Information\", \"Index\", \"Trainers\")&lt;/li&gt;                             &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(\"Training Information\", \"Index\", \"Trainings\")&lt;/li&gt;                          &lt;/ul&gt;                     &lt;/nav&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/header&gt;         &lt;div id=\"body\"&gt;             @RenderSection(\"featured\", required: false)             &lt;section class=\"content-wrapper main-content clear-fix\"&gt;                 @RenderBody()             &lt;/section&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;footer&gt;             &lt;div class=\"content-wrapper\"&gt;                 &lt;div class=\"float-left\"&gt;                     &lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; @DateTime.Now.Year - My ASP.NET MVC Application&lt;/p&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/footer&gt;          @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/jquery\")         @RenderSection(\"scripts\", required: false)     &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;   Step 7: Add migration and update database Run the following command in the package manager console.   PM&gt; Enable-Migrations PM&gt; Add-Migration initialmigration PM&gt; Update-Database –Verbose   After running the above the command, database table will be created in the metioned database.   Now your project is ready. Run your project and go to the Trainer and Training information link and you can View, insert, update and delete an entry. Let’s try. Yes it’s working.

        "title": "A Mini SPA with ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS",
        "excerpt":"SPA stands for Single Page Application; I think you already have little idea on it. Here I will demonstrate a mini SPA with ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS. So, let’s start.   Step 1: Create a ASP.NET MVC application with empty template      Open visual studio, Got to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project   Select Template -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web -&gt; ASP.NET MVC 4 Web application and click OK   Select Empty Template and Razor as view engine   Step 2: Install required packages      Run the following command in Package Manager Console (Tools-&gt;Library Package Manager-&gt;Package Manager Console) to install required package.   Make sure your internet connection is enabled.   PM&gt; Install-Package jQuery PM&gt; Install-Package angularjs -Version 1.0.7 PM&gt; Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json   Step 3: Create View model  In this application I will try to demonstrate two pages for Trainer and Training. For this purpose, create TrainerVM, TrainingVM, RegistrationVm view model in Model folder. JSONBuilder is a class in Model folder which make model as json serialized.   public class TrainingVm {     public string TrainingCode { get; set; }     public string Title { get; set; }     public string Trainer { get; set; } }    public class TrainerVm {     public string Name { get; set; }     public string Email { get; set; }     public string Venue { get; set; } }    public class RegistrationVm {     public string Trainings { get; set; }     public string Trainers { get; set; } }      public class JSONBuilder {     public RegistrationVm BuildRegistrationVm()     {         var registrationVm = new RegistrationVm         {             Trainings = GetSerializedTraining(),             Trainers = GetSerializedTrainers()         };          return registrationVm;     }      public string GetSerializedTraining()     {         var trainings = new[]             {                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA001\", Title = \"ASP.NET MVC 4\", Trainer=\"Mahedee Hasan\"},                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA002\", Title = \"ASP.NET Web Form\", Trainer=\"Asrafuzzaman\"},                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA003\", Title = \"AngularJs Fundamental\", Trainer=\"Foysal Alam\"},                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA004\", Title = \"ASP.NET MVC 5 with web API\", Trainer=\"Asfaquzzaman\"},             };         var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings { ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver() };         var serializeCourses = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(trainings, Formatting.None, settings);         return serializeCourses;     }       public string GetSerializedTrainers()     {         var trainers = new[]             {                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Mahedee Hasan\", Email = \"mahedee.hasan@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Asrafuzzaman\", Email = \"asraf@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Foysal Alam\", Email = \"foysal@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Asfaquzzaman\", Email = \"asfaq@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},             };         var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings { ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver() };         var serializedInstructors = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(trainers, Formatting.None, settings);         return serializedInstructors;     } }   Step 4: Create a RegistrationController in controller folder   public class RegistrationController : Controller {     private JSONBuilder jsonBuilder = new JSONBuilder();      public ActionResult Index()     {         return View(jsonBuilder.BuildRegistrationVm());     }  }   Step 5: Create TrainingController and TrainerController     Create TrainingsController.js and TrainersController.js in Scripts-&gt;Application-&gt;Controllers folder   TrainersController.js   'use strict';   registrationModule.controller(\"TrainersController\", function ($scope, registrationData) {     $scope.trainers = registrationData.trainers; });    TrainingsController.js   'use strict';   registrationModule.controller(\"TrainingsController\", function ($scope, registrationData) {     $scope.trainings = registrationData.trainings; });   I will define registrationModule and registrationData in next steps.   Step 6: Create registrationModule     Create registrationModule.js in Scripts-&gt;Application. This is the configuration file for angular routing in client side.   var registrationModule = angular.module(\"registrationModule\", [])     .config(function ($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {         $routeProvider.when('/Registration/Trainings', {             templateUrl: '/templates/Trainings.html',             controller: 'TrainingsController'         });           $routeProvider.when('/Registration/Trainers', {             templateUrl: '/templates/trainers.html',             controller: 'TrainersController'         });           $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);     });    Here you might see that I map template and controller on corresponding routing. But I didn’t declare template yet. I will declare template in next steps.   Step 7: Create a layout page     Create a layout page in Views-&gt; Shared -&gt;_Layout.cshtml and add reference of angularjs, jquery and registration module.   &lt;html ng-app=\"registrationModule\"&gt;     &lt;head&gt;         &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/angular.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/jquery-2.1.1.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/registrationModule.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;           &lt;title&gt;Training Registration&lt;/title&gt;         @RenderSection(\"JavascriptInHead\", required:false)     &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;         @RenderBody()     &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;   Step 8: Create Index view     Right click on Index action of Registration controller and add a view. Modify the view as follows.   @model MiniSPA.Models.RegistrationVm   @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Training Regirstration\";     Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\"; }   @section JavascriptInHead {     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/Controllers/TrainersController.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/Controllers/TrainingsController.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;         registrationModule.factory('registrationData', function() {             return {                 trainings: @Html.Raw(Model.Trainings),                 trainers: @Html.Raw(Model.Trainers)                 };         });     &lt;/script&gt; }   &lt;div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;div&gt;                 &lt;ul&gt;                     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Training Registration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                 &lt;/ul&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;div&gt;                 &lt;ul&gt;                     &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/Registration/Trainings\"&gt;Trainings Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                     &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/Registration/Trainers\"&gt;Trainer Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                 &lt;/ul&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    Step 9: Create template     Create training.html and trainer.html in templates folder as follows   Trainer.html   &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;      &lt;div class=\"span10\"&gt;          &lt;h2&gt;Instructors&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;      &lt;div class=\"span10\"&gt;          &lt;table class=\"table table-condensed table-hover\"&gt;              &lt;tr&gt;                  &lt;th&gt;Trainer Name&lt;/th&gt;                  &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;                  &lt;th&gt;Venue&lt;/th&gt;              &lt;/tr&gt;              &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"trainer in trainers\"&gt;                  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;              &lt;/tr&gt;          &lt;/table&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   Training.html   &lt;div&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;h2&gt;Training Details&lt;/h2&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;table&gt;                 &lt;tr&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Training Code&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Training Title&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Trainer Name&lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;                 &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"training in trainings\"&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;/table&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;    Step 10: Modify RouteConfig.cs     Modify the RouteConfig.cs as follows for routing Registration controller default and catching all other parameter.   public class RouteConfig {     public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)     {         routes.IgnoreRoute(\"{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}\");          routes.MapRoute(         name: \"Mini SPA\",         url: \"Registration/{*catchall}\",         defaults: new { controller = \"Registration\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional }         );           routes.MapRoute(             name: \"Default\",             url: \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\",             defaults: new { controller = \"Registration\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional }         );     } }   This structure is not best. So it is not recommended for large application. For large application use service. Hope, I will publish a complete SPA soon. Thanks for your patient!

        "title": "A Mini SPA with ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS",
        "excerpt":"SPA stands for Single Page Application; I think you already have little idea on it. Here I will demonstrate a mini SPA with ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS. So, let’s start.   Step 1: Create a ASP.NET MVC application with empty template      Open visual studio, Got to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project   Select Template -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web -&gt; ASP.NET MVC 4 Web application and click OK   Select Empty Template and Razor as view engine   Step 2: Install required packages      Run the following command in Package Manager Console (Tools-&gt;Library Package Manager-&gt;Package Manager Console) to install required package.   Make sure your internet connection is enabled.   PM&gt; Install-Package jQuery PM&gt; Install-Package angularjs -Version 1.0.7 PM&gt; Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json   Step 3: Create View model  In this application I will try to demonstrate two pages for Trainer and Training. For this purpose, create TrainerVM, TrainingVM, RegistrationVm view model in Model folder. JSONBuilder is a class in Model folder which make model as json serialized.   public class TrainingVm {     public string TrainingCode { get; set; }     public string Title { get; set; }     public string Trainer { get; set; } }    public class TrainerVm {     public string Name { get; set; }     public string Email { get; set; }     public string Venue { get; set; } }    public class RegistrationVm {     public string Trainings { get; set; }     public string Trainers { get; set; } }      public class JSONBuilder {     public RegistrationVm BuildRegistrationVm()     {         var registrationVm = new RegistrationVm         {             Trainings = GetSerializedTraining(),             Trainers = GetSerializedTrainers()         };          return registrationVm;     }      public string GetSerializedTraining()     {         var trainings = new[]             {                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA001\", Title = \"ASP.NET MVC 4\", Trainer=\"Mahedee Hasan\"},                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA002\", Title = \"ASP.NET Web Form\", Trainer=\"Asrafuzzaman\"},                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA003\", Title = \"AngularJs Fundamental\", Trainer=\"Foysal Alam\"},                 new TrainingVm {TrainingCode = \"TRA004\", Title = \"ASP.NET MVC 5 with web API\", Trainer=\"Asfaquzzaman\"},             };         var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings { ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver() };         var serializeCourses = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(trainings, Formatting.None, settings);         return serializeCourses;     }       public string GetSerializedTrainers()     {         var trainers = new[]             {                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Mahedee Hasan\", Email = \"mahedee.hasan@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Asrafuzzaman\", Email = \"asraf@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Foysal Alam\", Email = \"foysal@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},                 new TrainerVm {Name = \"Asfaquzzaman\", Email = \"asfaq@gmail.com\", Venue=\"Leadsoft Bangladesh Ltd\"},             };         var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings { ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver() };         var serializedInstructors = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(trainers, Formatting.None, settings);         return serializedInstructors;     } }   Step 4: Create a RegistrationController in controller folder   public class RegistrationController : Controller {     private JSONBuilder jsonBuilder = new JSONBuilder();      public ActionResult Index()     {         return View(jsonBuilder.BuildRegistrationVm());     }  }   Step 5: Create TrainingController and TrainerController     Create TrainingsController.js and TrainersController.js in Scripts-&gt;Application-&gt;Controllers folder   TrainersController.js   'use strict';   registrationModule.controller(\"TrainersController\", function ($scope, registrationData) {     $scope.trainers = registrationData.trainers; });    TrainingsController.js   'use strict';   registrationModule.controller(\"TrainingsController\", function ($scope, registrationData) {     $scope.trainings = registrationData.trainings; });   I will define registrationModule and registrationData in next steps.   Step 6: Create registrationModule     Create registrationModule.js in Scripts-&gt;Application. This is the configuration file for angular routing in client side.   var registrationModule = angular.module(\"registrationModule\", [])     .config(function ($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {         $routeProvider.when('/Registration/Trainings', {             templateUrl: '/templates/Trainings.html',             controller: 'TrainingsController'         });           $routeProvider.when('/Registration/Trainers', {             templateUrl: '/templates/trainers.html',             controller: 'TrainersController'         });           $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);     });    Here you might see that I map template and controller on corresponding routing. But I didn’t declare template yet. I will declare template in next steps.   Step 7: Create a layout page     Create a layout page in Views-&gt; Shared -&gt;_Layout.cshtml and add reference of angularjs, jquery and registration module.   &lt;html ng-app=\"registrationModule\"&gt;     &lt;head&gt;         &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/angular.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/jquery-2.1.1.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/registrationModule.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;           &lt;title&gt;Training Registration&lt;/title&gt;         @RenderSection(\"JavascriptInHead\", required:false)     &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;         @RenderBody()     &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;   Step 8: Create Index view     Right click on Index action of Registration controller and add a view. Modify the view as follows.   @model MiniSPA.Models.RegistrationVm   @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Training Regirstration\";     Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\"; }   @section JavascriptInHead {     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/Controllers/TrainersController.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/Controllers/TrainingsController.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;         registrationModule.factory('registrationData', function() {             return {                 trainings: @Html.Raw(Model.Trainings),                 trainers: @Html.Raw(Model.Trainers)                 };         });     &lt;/script&gt; }   &lt;div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;div&gt;                 &lt;ul&gt;                     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Training Registration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                 &lt;/ul&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;div&gt;                 &lt;ul&gt;                     &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/Registration/Trainings\"&gt;Trainings Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                     &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/Registration/Trainers\"&gt;Trainer Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                 &lt;/ul&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    Step 9: Create template     Create training.html and trainer.html in templates folder as follows   Trainer.html   &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;      &lt;div class=\"span10\"&gt;          &lt;h2&gt;Instructors&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;      &lt;div class=\"span10\"&gt;          &lt;table class=\"table table-condensed table-hover\"&gt;              &lt;tr&gt;                  &lt;th&gt;Trainer Name&lt;/th&gt;                  &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;                  &lt;th&gt;Venue&lt;/th&gt;              &lt;/tr&gt;              &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"trainer in trainers\"&gt;                  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                  &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;              &lt;/tr&gt;          &lt;/table&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   Training.html   &lt;div&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;h2&gt;Training Details&lt;/h2&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;table&gt;                 &lt;tr&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Training Code&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Training Title&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Trainer Name&lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;                 &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"training in trainings\"&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;/table&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;    Step 10: Modify RouteConfig.cs     Modify the RouteConfig.cs as follows for routing Registration controller default and catching all other parameter.   public class RouteConfig {     public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)     {         routes.IgnoreRoute(\"{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}\");          routes.MapRoute(         name: \"Mini SPA\",         url: \"Registration/{*catchall}\",         defaults: new { controller = \"Registration\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional }         );           routes.MapRoute(             name: \"Default\",             url: \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\",             defaults: new { controller = \"Registration\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional }         );     } }   This structure is not best. So it is not recommended for large application. For large application use service. Hope, I will publish a complete SPA soon. Thanks for your patient!

        "excerpt":"SPA stands for Single Page Application. Here I will demonstrate a simple SPA with ASP.NET MVC, Web API and Entity Framework. I will show a trainer profile and its CRUD operation using AngularJS, ASP.NET MVC, Web api and Entity Framework.   Step 1: Create a ASP.NET MVC application with empty template      Open visual studio, Got to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project   Select Template -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web -&gt; ASP.NET MVC 4 Web application and click OK   Select Empty Template and Razor as view engine   Step 2: Install required nuget packages     Run the following command in Package Manager Console (Tools-&gt;Library Package Manager-&gt;Package Manager Console) to install required package.   Make sure your internet connection is enabled.   PM&gt; Install-Package jQuery PM&gt; Install-Package angularjs -Version 1.2.26 PM&gt; Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json PM&gt; Install-Package MvcScaffolding   Step 3: Create Connection String  Create connection string and name DB name as SPADB   &lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name=\"SPAContext\" connectionString=\"Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=SPADB;Integrated Security=SSPI;\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;   Step 4: Create model class      Create Trainer model   public class Trainer {     [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]     public long Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }     public string Email { get; set; }     public string Venue { get; set; } }   Step 5: Create Repository     Create repository for Trainer model.   Run the following command in Package Manager Console (Tools-&gt;Library Package Manager-&gt;Package Manager Console) to create repository.   I used repository pattern for well-structured and more manageable.   PM&gt; Scaffold Repository Trainer   After running the above command you will see SPAContext.cs and TrainerRepository.cs created in Model folder. For well manageability, I create a directory name Repository and put these two files in the Repository folder. So change the namespace as like SPA.Repository instead of SPA.Model. I also create a UnitOfWork for implement unit of work pattern.   The overall folder structure looks like below.      SPAContext.cs    public class SPAContext : DbContext {     public SPAContext()         : base(\"SPAContext\")     {     }     // You can add custom code to this file. Changes will not be overwritten.     //      // If you want Entity Framework to drop and regenerate your database     // automatically whenever you change your model schema, add the following     // code to the Application_Start method in your Global.asax file.     // Note: this will destroy and re-create your database with every model change.     //      // System.Data.Entity.Database.SetInitializer(new System.Data.Entity.DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges&lt;SPA.Models.SPAContext&gt;());       public DbSet&lt;SPA.Models.Trainer&gt; Trainers { get; set; }       public DbSet&lt;SPA.Models.Training&gt; Trainings { get; set; } }    TrainerRepository.cs   public class TrainerRepository : ITrainerRepository {     SPAContext context = new SPAContext();       public TrainerRepository()         : this(new SPAContext())     {       }     public TrainerRepository(SPAContext context)     {         this.context = context;     }         public IQueryable&lt;Trainer&gt; All     {         get { return context.Trainers; }     }       public IQueryable&lt;Trainer&gt; AllIncluding(params Expression&lt;Func&lt;Trainer, object&gt;&gt;[] includeProperties)     {         IQueryable&lt;Trainer&gt; query = context.Trainers;         foreach (var includeProperty in includeProperties)         {             query = query.Include(includeProperty);         }         return query;     }       public Trainer Find(long id)     {         return context.Trainers.Find(id);     }       public void InsertOrUpdate(Trainer trainer)     {         if (trainer.Id == default(long))         {             // New entity             context.Trainers.Add(trainer);         }         else         {             // Existing entity             context.Entry(trainer).State = System.Data.Entity.EntityState.Modified;         }     }       public void Delete(long id)     {         var trainer = context.Trainers.Find(id);         context.Trainers.Remove(trainer);     }       public void Save()     {         context.SaveChanges();     }       public void Dispose()     {         context.Dispose();     } }   public interface ITrainerRepository : IDisposable {     IQueryable&lt;Trainer&gt; All { get; }     IQueryable&lt;Trainer&gt; AllIncluding(params Expression&lt;Func&lt;Trainer, object&gt;&gt;[] includeProperties);     Trainer Find(long id);     void InsertOrUpdate(Trainer trainer);     void Delete(long id);     void Save(); }   UnitOfWork.cs   public class UnitOfWork : IDisposable {     private SPAContext context;     public UnitOfWork()     {         context = new SPAContext();     }       public UnitOfWork(SPAContext _context)     {         this.context = _context;     }       private TrainingRepository _trainingRepository;       public TrainingRepository TrainingRepository     {         get         {               if (this._trainingRepository == null)             {                 this._trainingRepository = new TrainingRepository(context);             }             return _trainingRepository;         }     }         private TrainerRepository _trainerRepository;       public TrainerRepository TrainerRepository     {         get         {               if (this._trainerRepository == null)             {                 this._trainerRepository = new TrainerRepository(context);             }             return _trainerRepository;         }     }       public void Dispose()     {         context.Dispose();         GC.SuppressFinalize(this);     } }    Step 6: Add migration      Run the following command to add migration   PM&gt; Enable-Migrations PM&gt; Add-Migration initialmigration PM&gt; Update-Database –Verbose   Step 7: Create API Controllers     Create Trainers api Controllers by clicking right button on Controller folder   Choose API controller with empty read/write actions as scaffolding template   Click Add button.   Step 8: Modify Controllers      Now modify the controllers as follows. Here I used unit of work pattern.   public class TrainersController : ApiController {     private UnitOfWork unitOfWork = new UnitOfWork();       public IEnumerable&lt;Trainer&gt; Get()     {         List&lt;Trainer&gt; lstTrainer = new List&lt;Trainer&gt;();         lstTrainer = unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.All.ToList();         return lstTrainer;     }       //// GET api/trainers/5     public Trainer Get(int id)     {         Trainer objTrainer = unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.Find(id);         return objTrainer;     }         public HttpResponseMessage Post(Trainer trainer)     {           if (ModelState.IsValid)         {             unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.InsertOrUpdate(trainer);             unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.Save();             return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);         }         return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError);     }         private IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; GetErrorMessages()     {         return ModelState.Values.SelectMany(x =&gt; x.Errors.Select(e =&gt; e.ErrorMessage));     }           // PUT api/trainers/5     public HttpResponseMessage Put(int Id, Trainer trainer)     {         if (ModelState.IsValid)         {             unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.InsertOrUpdate(trainer);             unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.Save();             return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);         }         else             return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError);     }       // DELETE api/trainers/5     public HttpResponseMessage Delete(int id)     {         Trainer objTrainer = unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.Find(id);         if (objTrainer == null)         {             return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError);         }           unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.Delete(id);         unitOfWork.TrainerRepository.Save();           return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);     } }    Step 9: Create Layout and Home Controller     Create _Layout.cshtml in Views-&gt;Shared folder   Create HomeController and create inext view of Home controller by right click on index action and add view. You will see index.cshtml is created in Views-&gt;Home   HomeController.cs   public class HomeController : Controller {     //     // GET: /Home/       public ActionResult Index()     {         return View();     }   }    _Layout.cshtml   &lt;html ng-app=\"registrationModule\"&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;title&gt;Training Registration&lt;/title&gt;   &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;     @RenderBody() &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;   Index.cshtml   @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Home\";     Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\"; }   &lt;h2&gt;Home&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;div&gt;     &lt;ul&gt;               &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/Registration/Trainers\"&gt;Trainer Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/Registration/Trainers/add\"&gt;Add New Trainer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    Step 10: Create registrationModule      Create registrationModule.js in Scripts-&gt;Application. This is for angularjs routing.   var registrationModule = angular.module(\"registrationModule\", ['ngRoute', 'ngResource'])     .config(function ($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {           $routeProvider.when('/Registration/Trainers', {             templateUrl: '/templates/trainers/all.html',             controller: 'listTrainersController'         });           $routeProvider.when('/Registration/Trainers/:id', {             templateUrl: '/templates/trainers/edit.html',             controller: 'editTrainersController'         });           $routeProvider.when('/Registration/Trainers/add', {             templateUrl: '/templates/trainers/add.html',             controller: 'addTrainersController'         });           $routeProvider.when(\"/Registration/Trainers/delete/:id\", {             controller: \"deleteTrainersController\",             templateUrl: \"/templates/trainers/delete.html\"         });           $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);     });    Step 11: Create trainerRepository      Create trainerRepository.js in Scripts-&gt;Application-&gt;Repository. This increase manageability for large application.    'use strict';   //Repository for trainer information registrationModule.factory('trainerRepository', function ($resource) {       return {         get: function () {             return $resource('/api/Trainers').query();         },           getById: function (id) {             return $resource('/api/Trainers/:Id', { Id: id }).get();         },           save: function (trainer) {             return $resource('/api/Trainers').save(trainer);         },           put: function (trainer) {             return $resource('/api/Trainers', { Id: trainer.id },                 {                     update: { method: 'PUT' }                 }).update(trainer);         },           remove: function (id) {             return $resource('/api/Trainers').remove({ Id: id });         }     };   });    Step 12: Create trainerController      Create trainerController.js in Scripts-&gt;Application-&gt;Controllers   'use strict';   //Controller to get list of trainers informaion registrationModule.controller(\"listTrainersController\", function ($scope, trainerRepository, $location) {     $scope.trainers = trainerRepository.get(); });     //Controller to save trainer information registrationModule.controller(\"addTrainersController\", function ($scope, trainerRepository, $location) {     $scope.save = function (trainer) {         trainer.Id = 0;         $scope.errors = [];         trainerRepository.save(trainer).$promise.then(             function () { $location.url('Registration/Trainers'); },             function (response) { $scope.errors = response.data; });     }; });     //Controller to modify trainer information registrationModule.controller(\"editTrainersController\", function ($scope,$routeParams, trainerRepository, $location) {     $scope.trainer = trainerRepository.getById($routeParams.id);       $scope.update = function (trainer) {         $scope.errors = [];         trainerRepository.put(trainer).$promise.then(             function () { $location.url('Registration/Trainers'); },             function (response) { $scope.errors = response.data; });     }; });   //Controller to delete trainer information registrationModule.controller(\"deleteTrainersController\", function ($scope, $routeParams, trainerRepository, $location) {         trainerRepository.remove($routeParams.id).$promise.then(             function () { $location.url('Registration/Trainers'); },             function (response) { $scope.errors = response.data; }); });    Step 13: Create templates     Create all.html, add.html, edit.html, delete.html in templateds-&gt;trainers folder.   All.html   &lt;div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         &lt;h2&gt;Trainers Details&lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         &lt;table&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;th&gt;Name &lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;th&gt;Email &lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;th&gt;Venue &lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;th&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"trainer in trainers\"&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;a title=\"Delete\" ng-href=\"/Registration/Trainers/delete/\"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;                     |&lt;a title=\"Edit\" ng-href=\"/Registration/Trainers/\"&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;/table&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   Add.html   &lt;form name=\"trainerForm\" novalidate ng-submit=\"save(trainer)\"&gt;     &lt;table&gt;         &lt;tbody&gt;               &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;Trainer Name                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\" ng-model=\"trainer.name\" required ng-minlength=\"5\" /&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;Email                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input name=\"email\" type=\"text\" ng-model=\"trainer.email\" /&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;Venue                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input name=\"venue\" type=\"text\" ng-model=\"trainer.venue\" /&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;               &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td class=\"width30\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Save\" ng-disabled=\"trainerForm.$invalid\" /&gt;                     &lt;a href=\"/Registration/Trainers\" class=\"btn btn-inverse\"&gt;Cancel&lt;/a&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;/tbody&gt;     &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/form&gt;    Edit.html   &lt;form name=\"trainerFrom\" novalidate abide&gt;     &lt;table&gt;         &lt;tbody&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input name=\"id\" type=\"hidden\" ng-model=\"trainer.id\"/&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;Name                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\" ng-model=\"trainer.name\" /&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;Email                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input name=\"email\" type=\"text\" ng-model=\"trainer.email\" /&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;Venue                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;textarea name=\"venue\" ng-model=\"trainer.venue\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;tr&gt;                 &lt;td class=\"width30\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" ng-click=\"update(trainer)\" ng-disabled=\"trainerFrom.$invalid\"&gt;Update&lt;/button&gt;                   &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;/tbody&gt;     &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/form&gt;    Step 14: Add references to the Layout     Modify the _Layout.cshtml to add references   _Layout.cshtml   &lt;html ng-app=\"registrationModule\"&gt; &lt;head&gt;         &lt;title&gt;Training Registration&lt;/title&gt;       &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/angular.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/angular-resource.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/angular-route.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/jquery-2.1.1.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/registrationModule.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/Repository/trainerRepository.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/Application/Controllers/trainersController.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;     @RenderBody() &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;    Now run you application and add, delete, modify and get all trainer information.

        "title": "A SignalR Application for Real Time Notification Using AngularJS and Toastr",
        "excerpt":"SignalR is a new developer’s API provided for ASP.NET web applications, used to add “real time” web functionality to ASP.NET applications. “Real Time” web functionality is the ability to have server code to push contents to connected clients.   Uses of SignalR     Notification   Chat application   Real time monitoring application   Job progress update etc.   So, let’s start to create a SignalR Application. In this program I will assign a task for a person and everybody will get notification.   Step 1: Create a ASP.NET MVC application with basic template      Open visual studio, Got to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project   Select Template -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web -&gt; ASP.NET MVC 4 Web application and click OK   Select Basic Template and Razor as view engine   Step 2: Install required packages     Install nuget package for SignalR. To install click right button of the project and then click Manages NuGet packages.   Search SignalR and then install “Microsoft ASP.NET SignalR” .   Run the following command in package manager console to install packages   PM&gt; Install-Package angularjs PM&gt; Install-Package toastr  Step 3: Create Startup class      Create a Startup class in project root directory. Create Stratup.cs file and modify as follows.   using Microsoft.Owin; using Owin;   [assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(SignalRApp.Startup))]   namespace SignalRApp {     public class Startup     {         public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)         {             app.MapSignalR();         }     } }    Step 4: Create signalR hub      Create a SignalR hub name NotificationHub in root directory and inherit Hub class.   Modify the class as follows   using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR; using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hubs; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web;   namespace SignalRApp {           [HubName(\"notification\")]     public class NotificationHub : Hub     {          public void PushNotification(string msg)          {              Clients.All.response(msg);          }     } }    Here Clients.All means all user will get notification. It can be configured on the basis of group and individual.   Step 5: Create HomeController and index view   Create a Home controller by right click on controller folder. Create an index view in Views-&gt;Hoome-&gt;index.cshtml by right clicking in index action of Home controller.   HomeController.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.Mvc;   namespace SignalRApp.Controllers {     public class HomeController : Controller     {         //         // GET: /Home/           public ActionResult Index()         {             return View();         }       } }    Index.cshtml    @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Index\";     Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\"; }   &lt;h2&gt;Please entry a task&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;form name =\"taskForm\" id=\"taskformid\" ng-controller=\"mainController\"&gt;     Enter a Task:    &lt;input name=\"txtTask\" id=\"txtTask\" type=\"text\" /&gt;    &lt;button ng-click=\"sendMessage()\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt;    Here mainController and sendMessage() is declared. I will define it later.   Step 6: Change bundle config      Change BundleConfig and add customScripts, angular, signalr, jquery, toastr buddle as follows.   public class BundleConfig {     // For more information on Bundling, visit http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254725     public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)     {         bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/customScripts\").Include(                   \"~/Scripts/Application/app.js\",                   \"~/Scripts/Application/mainController.js\"));             bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/angular\").Include(                    \"~/Scripts/angular.js\"));           bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/signalr\").Include(                    \"~/Scripts/jquery.signalR-2.1.2.js\"));                                 bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jquery\").Include(                     \"~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js\"));           bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jqueryui\").Include(                     \"~/Scripts/jquery-ui-{version}.js\"));           bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jqueryval\").Include(                     \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive*\",                     \"~/Scripts/jquery.validate*\"));             bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/toastr\").Include(                     \"~/Scripts/toastr.js*\"));           // Use the development version of Modernizr to develop with and learn from. Then, when you're         // ready for production, use the build tool at http://modernizr.com to pick only the tests you need.         bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/modernizr\").Include(                     \"~/Scripts/modernizr-*\"));           //bundles.Add(new StyleBundle(\"~/Content/css\").Include(\"~/Content/site.css\"));           bundles.Add(new StyleBundle(\"~/Content/themes/base/css\").Include(                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.core.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.resizable.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.selectable.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.accordion.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.autocomplete.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.button.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.dialog.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.slider.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.tabs.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.datepicker.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.progressbar.css\",                     \"~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.theme.css\"));           bundles.Add(new StyleBundle(\"~/Content/css\").Include(            //\"~/Content/bootstrap.css\",            \"~/Content/toastr.css\",            \"~/Content/site.css\"));             BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = false;     } }    Here I add app.js and mainController.js in customScripts bundle. I will add it later. And add bundle reference and ng-app in Views-&gt;Shared-&gt;_Layout.cshtml   _Layout.cshtml   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;     &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" /&gt;     &lt;title&gt;@ViewBag.Title&lt;/title&gt;     @Styles.Render(\"~/Content/css\")     @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/modernizr\") &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body ng-app=\"app\"&gt;     @RenderBody()       @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/jquery\")     @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/toastr\")     @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/signalr\")     &lt;script src=\"signalr/hubs\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/angular\")     @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/customScripts\")           @RenderSection(\"scripts\", required: false) &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;    Step 7: Add app.js and mainController.js in Scripts-&gt;Application folder   App.js   (function () {     angular.module('app', []);       $(function () {         $.connection.hub.logging = true;         $.connection.hub.start();     });         $.connection.hub.error(function (err) {         console.log('An error occurred: ' + err);     });       angular.module('app')        .value('notification', $.connection.notification)        .value('toastr', toastr);   })();    mainController.js   angular.module('app').controller('mainController', function ($scope, notification, toastr) {     $scope.messages = [];       $scope.sendMessage = function () {         var inputval = taskForm.elements.txtTask.value;         taskForm.elements.txtTask.value = \"\";         notification.server.pushNotification(inputval);         $scope.newMessage = \"\";     };       notification.client.response = function onNewMessage(message) {         displayMessage(message);         $scope.$apply();     };       function displayMessage(message) {         toastr.success(message); //To nofiy as fadin and fadout     }   });    Now run the application and write a text in text box, open two or three browser, you will get same notification like below.

        "excerpt":"toastr is a simple JavaScript toast notification library that is small, easy to use, and extendable. It is mostly used to show notification and its outlook is very nice and responsive. It allows you to create simple toasts with HTML5 and JavaScript like following:      Let’s use toastr in a simple asp.net MVC application.   Step 1: Create a ASP.NET MVC application with basic template      Open visual studio, Go to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project   Select Template -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web -&gt; ASP.NET MVC 4 Web application and click OK   Select Basic Template and Razor as view engine   Step 2: Install required packages   Run the following command in package manager console to install packages   PM&gt; Install-Package toastr   Step 3: Create HomeController and index view   Create a Home controller by right click on controller folder. Create an index view in Views -&gt; Home -&gt; Index.cshtml by right clicking in index action of Home controller.   HomeController.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.Mvc;   namespace Toastr.Controllers {     public class HomeController : Controller     {         //         // GET: /Home/           public ActionResult Index()         {             return View();         }       } }    Index.cshtml   @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Index\";     Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\"; }   &lt;h2&gt;Toastr Implimentation&lt;/h2&gt;    Step 5: Modify BundleConfig.cs   BundleConfig.cs   using System.Web; using System.Web.Optimization;   namespace Toastr {     public class BundleConfig     {         // For more information on Bundling, visit http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254725         public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)         {             bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jquery\").Include(                         \"~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js\"));               bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jqueryui\").Include(                         \"~/Scripts/jquery-ui-{version}.js\"));               bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jqueryval\").Include(                         \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive*\",                         \"~/Scripts/jquery.validate*\"));               //Added for toaster             bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/toastr\").Include(                        \"~/Scripts/toastr.js*\",                        \"~/Scripts/toastrImp.js\"));                 // Use the development version of Modernizr to develop with and learn from.

        "excerpt":"In this article I will show how JSON serialize in ASP.NET MVC and bind data by AngularJs. I will not describe what and how JSON, ASP.NET MVC or AngularJs work. Hope I will discuss these topics in another article.   Let’s start to create an ASP.NET MVC project with AngularJs.   Step 1: Create ASP.NET MVC application      Open visual studio, Got to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project   Select Template -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web -&gt; ASP.NET MVC 4 Web application and click OK   Select Empty Template and Razor as view engine   Step 2: Install required packages     Run the following command in Package Manager Console (Tools-&gt;Library Package Manager-&gt;Package Manager Console) to install required package.   PM&gt; Install-Package jQuery PM&gt; Install-Package angularjs -Version 1.2.26 PM&gt; Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json   Step 3: Create a layout page     Create a layout page in Views-&gt; Shared -&gt;_Layout.cshtml and add reference of angularjs and jquery.   &lt;html ng-app&gt;     &lt;head&gt;             &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/angular.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/jquery-2.1.1.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;title&gt;Student Information&lt;/title&gt;     &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;         @RenderBody()     &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;   Step 4: Create a view model “Student” in model folder   public class StudentVM {    public int RollNo { get; set; }    public string StudentName { get; set; }    public string Class { get; set; }    public string ClassTeacher { get; set; } }   Step 5: Create StudentsController     Create StudentsController in Controller folder like following. Here GetSerializedStudentVMS method serialized Student model to JSON.   public class StudentsController : Controller   {       //       // GET: /Students/        public ActionResult Index()       {           return View(\"Index\", \"\", GetSerializedStudentVMS());       }        public string GetSerializedStudentVMS()       {           var students = new[]             {                   new StudentVM {RollNo = 1, StudentName = \"Jamal Uddin\", Class=\"One\", ClassTeacher=\"Mr. Anowar Hossain\"},                   new StudentVM {RollNo = 5, StudentName = \"Kamal Hossain\", Class=\"Two\", ClassTeacher=\"Mr. Shahana Begum\"},                   new StudentVM {RollNo = 10, StudentName = \"Jahid Hasan\", Class=\"Three\", ClassTeacher=\"Mr. Lutfor Rahman\"},               };                      //Used to make property name as camel case           var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings { ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver() };            return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(students, Formatting.None, settings); //Returns students list as JSON       }    }    Step 6: Create index view          Right click of index action of StudentsController, click view and a view will automatically create to Views-&gt; Students -&gt;index.cshtml            Change the index.cshtml like following       @model string   @{     Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\"; } &lt;div ng-init=\"students = @Html.Raw(Model)\"&gt;     &lt;div&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;table&gt;                 &lt;tr&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Roll No&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Student Name&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Course Teacher&lt;/th&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;                 &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"student in students\"&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                     &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;/table&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   Here ng-init used to initialize the json object and ng-repeat works like foreach.   Step 7: Change RouteConfig.cs      Change RouteConfig like following to run StudentController by default.     public class RouteConfig {   public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)   {       routes.IgnoreRoute(\"{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}\");        routes.MapRoute(           name: \"Default\",           url: \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\",           defaults: new { controller = \"Students\", action = \"Index\", id = UrlParameter.Optional }       );   } }           Now run the application. Yes you will see the student information in a table. Thanks for your patient    ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","Bootstrap","C#"],

Right click on index action of home controller you will see index.cshtml file created in Views-&gt;Home folder. Modify the index.cshtml file like following   Index.cshtml   @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Index\";     Layout = \"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\"; } &lt;h2&gt;Home Page&lt;/h2&gt;   Step 6: Add Navigation bar   If you go the preview of the theme you will see some sample code or documentation. You can customize later. To add navigation bar to the website I modify the _Layout.cshtml like following.   _Layout.cshtml   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;   &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;title&gt;Bootstrap theme test&lt;/title&gt;     &lt;link href=\"~/Content/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;     &lt;link href=\"~/Content/bootstrap-main-theme.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/jquery-1.9.1.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;script src=\"~/Scripts/bootstrap.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;     &lt;div class=\"navbar navbar-inverse\"&gt;   &lt;div class=\"navbar-header\"&gt;     &lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"navbar-toggle\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\".navbar-inverse-collapse\"&gt;       &lt;span class=\"icon-bar\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=\"icon-bar\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=\"icon-bar\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/button&gt;     &lt;a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"#\"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class=\"navbar-collapse collapse navbar-inverse-collapse\"&gt;     &lt;ul class=\"nav navbar-nav\"&gt;       &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Active&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       &lt;li class=\"dropdown\"&gt;         &lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\"&gt;Dropdown &lt;b class=\"caret\"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;ul class=\"dropdown-menu\"&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Another action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Something else here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li class=\"divider\"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li class=\"dropdown-header\"&gt;Dropdown header&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Separated link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;One more separated link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;/ul&gt;       &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;     &lt;form class=\"navbar-form navbar-left\"&gt;       &lt;input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control col-lg-8\" placeholder=\"Search\"&gt;     &lt;/form&gt;     &lt;ul class=\"nav navbar-nav navbar-right\"&gt;       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       &lt;li class=\"dropdown\"&gt;         &lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\"&gt;Dropdown &lt;b class=\"caret\"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;ul class=\"dropdown-menu\"&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Another action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Something else here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li class=\"divider\"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Separated link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;/ul&gt;       &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;div&gt;         @RenderBody()     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;   Now run the application, you will get a nice layout.

Soon, I will create those files.   Step 4: Create Application module, data and angular controller  Create app.js, data.js and studentCtrl.js in scripts -&gt; app folder. Content are given below.   app.js   var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource']);  data.js   app.value('studentInfo', [   { id: 1, name: 'Mahedee Hasan', credit:20, semester: '8th' },   { id: 2, name: 'Enamul Haque', credit: 15, semester: '7th' },   { id: 2, name: 'Arefin Billah', credit: 15, semester: '6th' },   { id: 3, name: 'Zahid Hasan', credit: 12, semester: '7th' } ]);   studentCtrl.js   app.controller('studentsCtrl', function ($scope, studentInfo) {     $scope.studentInfo = studentInfo; });   App.js for just declaring application module, data.js for hardcoded data by javascript and studentCtrl.js is the main angular controller.   Step 4: Create a Page for View   Create a page name Default.aspx, just right click on the application -&gt; Add -&gt; New item -&gt; Web form using master page. Select Master page and type page name as Default.aspx. Now modify the page as follows.    &lt;%@ Page Title=\"\" Language=\"C#\" MasterPageFile=\"~/Site.Master\" AutoEventWireup=\"true\" CodeBehind=\"Default.aspx.cs\" Inherits=\"AngularWeb.Default\" %&gt;   &lt;asp:Content ID=\"Content1\" ContentPlaceHolderID=\"HeadContent\" runat=\"server\"&gt; &lt;/asp:Content&gt; &lt;asp:Content ID=\"Content2\" ContentPlaceHolderID=\"MainContent\" runat=\"server\"&gt;       &lt;div class=\"container\" ng-controller=\"studentsCtrl\" ng-app=\"app\"&gt;           &lt;table class=\"table table-striped table-hover table-condensed\"&gt;             &lt;thead&gt;                 &lt;tr&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Id&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Credit&lt;/th&gt;                     &lt;th&gt;Semester&lt;/th&gt;                   &lt;/tr&gt;             &lt;/thead&gt;               &lt;tr ng-repeat=\"student in studentInfo\"&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;                 &lt;td&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;/table&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/asp:Content&gt;   Look at the page, here I add ng-controller and ng-app and ng-repeat. If you have little idea about angularJs, you must understand the code. Now just run the application and you will get following output. Happy programming.

Soon, I will create those files. Another thing that you must set EnablePageMethod=”True”   Step 4: Create Application module, data and angular controller  Create app.js, data.js and studentCtrl.js in scripts -&gt; app folder. Content are given below.   app.js   var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource']);   data.js   app.value('pageMethods', PageMethods);   app.factory('student', function (pageMethods, $rootScope) {     var result = [];     pageMethods.GetStudent(function (data) {         data.forEach(function (item) {             result.push({ id: item.Id, name: item.Name, semester: item.Semester, credits: item.Credits});         });         $rootScope.$apply();     });     return result; })  studentCtrl.js   app.controller('studentsCtrl', function ($scope, student) {     $scope.student = student; });   Here, App.js for just declaring application module, data.js for retrieving data using Page Methods and studentCtrl.js is the main angular controller. You must see, in data.js I have declare pageMethods and call a Page Method name “GetStudent”. This is not yet defines. I will create this method in next Step.   Step 4: Create a Page for View      Create a page name Default.aspx, just right click on the application -&gt; Add -&gt; New item -&gt; Web form using master page. Select Master page and type page name as Default.aspx. Now modify the page as follows.   Default.aspx.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.Services; using System.Web.UI; using System.Web.UI.WebControls;   namespace WebMathodAngular {     public partial class Default : System.Web.UI.Page     {         protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)         {           }           [WebMethod]         public static List&lt;Student&gt; GetStudent()         {             List&lt;Student&gt; lstStudents = new List&lt;Student&gt;()                 {                 new Student { Id= 1, Name= \"Mahedee Hasan\", Semester=\"5th\", Credits= 15},                 new Student { Id= 2, Name= \"Robiul Alam\", Semester=\"4th\", Credits= 20},                 new Student { Id= 3, Name= \"Amit Karmaker\", Semester=\"7th\", Credits= 12 },                 new Student { Id= 4, Name= \"Zahid Hasan\", Semester=\"8th\", Credits= 18},                 new Student { Id= 5, Name= \"Shafiqul Islam\", Semester=\"6th\", Credits= 15},                               };               return lstStudents;         }         }         public class Student     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public string Semester { get; set; }         public int Credits { get; set; }     }   }    In Deafult.aspx.cs file, you must see, I have created a Page Method which is annoted by WebMethod.

What should you do? This is not encouraged to create an application with ASP.NET web form and ASP.NET MVC together. If you need, you can use. So, let’s start. In this application I used Visual Studio 2012 and .NET framework 4.5   Step 1: Create a ASP.NET Web Forms Application      Open visual studio, Got to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project   Select Template -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web -&gt; ASP.NET Web Forms application, set location and click OK   Step 2: Add Reference     Click right button on the project -&gt; Add Reference -&gt;Extensions -&gt; System.web.mvc   And Add Reference -&gt; Framework -&gt; System.Web.Routing      Step 3: Configure Default Routing  Modify the Application_Start method of Global.asax file. Write down the following code snippet in the Application_Start method .   System.Web.Routing.RouteTable.Routes.MapRoute(\"Default\", \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\",                 new { Controller = \"Home\", action = \"index\", id = \"\" });   Here Route name is Default and default routing is {controller}/{action}/{id} . Here, default controller is Home and default action is index and default id is empty.   Step 4: Create Controller directory and Controller      Create a controller directory by right click on solution -&gt;Add -&gt; New folder -&gt; Controllers   Create a controller by right click on Controller folder -&gt; Add -&gt; Class -&gt; MyController (name of the class)   And create an action in MyController - name AboutMe like below.   MyController.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Web.Mvc;   namespace WebFormMVC.Controllers {     public class MyController : Controller     {         public JsonResult AboutMe()         {             return Json(new { name = \"Mahedee Hasan\", designation = \"Software Architect\"}, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);         }     } }    Now run the application, if you set default page of your application is default.aspx. You will see the output of as usual asp.net webform application. Now change the URL like : http://localhost:53598/My/Aboutme you will see a json output. This is actually MVC output.   If you are not clear in any portion or you have any suggestion, please leave your comment here. To run the application you may require some packages to download.

        "title": "Uses Of Dropdown List And Radio Button In ASP.NET MVC Application With Entity Framework",
        "excerpt":"Introduction  Dropdown list and Radio button are two very important controls for web. We frequently use it. In this article I will show you how to use dynamic dropdown list and radio button in CRUD operation.   Implementation Repository Pattern with ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework   Let’s create a University Ranking application and implement Dropdown list and Radio button dynamically. Here I only show you CRUD operation on University Information page. Tools and Technology used   I used following tools and technology to develop the project – Implementation of generic repository      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC 5   Entity Framework   Razor view engine   Step 1: Create an ASP.NET MVC 5 application using Visual Studio 2013. I kept the application name “UniversityRanking”. Help: How to create first application using asp.net MVC   Step 2: Configure connection string in web.config   &lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=UniversityDB;User ID=sa; Password=sa@123\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;   Step 3: Create three models – “Country, Category and University”   Country.cs   public class Country {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }   }   Category.cs    public class Category {      public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; } }   University.cs   public class University {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }     [Required]     public int CountryId { get; set; }      [ForeignKey(\"CountryId\")]     public virtual Country Country { get; set; }         [Required]     public int CategoryId { get; set; }     [ForeignKey(\"CategoryId\")]     public virtual Category Category { get; set; } }   Step 4: Create a DbContext name UniversityContext in Repository folder.   public class UniversityContext : DbContext {     public UniversityContext()         : base(\"DefaultConnection\")     {       }       public DbSet&lt;University&gt; Universities { get; set; }     public DbSet&lt;Category&gt; Categories { get; set; }     public DbSet&lt;Country&gt; Countries { get; set; }       protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)     {       } }    Step 5: Create a controller name – EmployeeController.     Select template “MVC5 Controller with views, using entity framework”. * EmployeeController will create in Controller folder and related views will be created in Views/Employee folder   Step 6: Now modify some of the action of UniversityController mentioned bellow (using comments).   public class UniversityController : Controller {     private UniversityContext db = new UniversityContext();       // GET: /University/     public ActionResult Index()     {         var universities = db.Universities.Include(u =&gt; u.Category).Include(u =&gt; u.Country);         return View(universities.ToList());     }       // GET: /University/Details/5     public ActionResult Details(int? id)     {         if (id == null)         {             return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);         }         University university = db.Universities.Find(id);         if (university == null)         {             return HttpNotFound();         }         return View(university);     }       // Modify Create Action.      //GET: /University/Create     public ActionResult Create()     {         //ViewBag.CategoryId = new SelectList(db.Categories, \"Id\", \"Name\");         ViewBag.Categories = db.Categories.ToList();         ViewBag.CountryId = new SelectList(db.Countries, \"Id\", \"Name\");         return View();     }       // Modifed following action     // POST: /University/Create     // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for      // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.

        "title": "CRUD Operation Using Asynchronous Method In ASP.NET MVC",
        "excerpt":"Introduction  In .NET framework 4.5 asynchronous programming concept has been introduced. In this regard, .NET introduced two keyword async and await. It is much easier to implement than the multi-threading concept. The .NET Framework 4 introduced an asynchronous programming concept referred to as a Task and ASP.NET MVC 4 supports Task. In this article I will show you a simple CRUD operation using asynchronous programming by async, await and Task.   A simple overview on “async, await, Task” Keyword   async      The async modifier indicates that the method, lambda expression, or anonymous method will work asynchronously.   Method with async modifier also called async method.   An async method provides a convenient way to do potentially long-running work without blocking the caller’s thread.   The caller of an async method can resume its work without waiting for the async method to finish.   Typically, a method modified by the async keyword contains at least one await expression or statement.   await      Typically await keyword used to free a thread   The await operator is applied to a task in an asynchronous method to suspend the execution of the method until the awaited task completes.   The asynchronous method in which await is used must be modified by the async keyword. Such a method, defined by using the async modifier, and usually containing one or more await expressions, is referred to as an async method.   The task to which the await operator is applied typically is the return value from a call to a method that implements.   Task      The main types are System.Threading.Tasks.Task   Represents an asynchronous operation that can be waited on and cancelled        System.Threading.Tasks.Task, which is a task that can return a value.

Let’s start.   Tools and Technology used  I used following tools and technology to develop the project –      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC 5   Entity Framework   Razor view engine   Step 1: Create an ASP.NET MVC 5 application using Visual Studio 2013.      Create an ASP.NET MVC 5 application name MVCAsync   Step 2: Configure connection string in web.config   &lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=EmployeeDB;User ID=sa; Password=sa@123\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;   Step 3: Create a model in model folder - Employee   Employee.cs   public class Employee  {      public int Id { get; set; }      public string Name { get; set; }      public string NickName { get; set; }      public string Designation { get; set; }      public string Dept { get; set; }  }   Step 4: Create a DbContext name EmployeeDBContext in Model folder.   public class EmployeeDBContext : DbContext {     public EmployeeDBContext()         : base(\"DefaultConnection\")     {     }       public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; } }    Step 5: Create a controller name – EmployeeController.      Select template - MVC5 Controller with views, using entity framework   EmployeeController will create in Controller folder and related views will be created in Views/Employee folder.   At the time of creating controller - mark use async controller action.      Step 6: Employee Controller is given below.     A simple difference over normal method is –            used async keyword in Action Method.       Used Task instead of typical ActionResult       And used await keyword in any operation.           public class EmployeeController : Controller  {      private EmployeeDBContext db = new EmployeeDBContext();        // GET: /Employee/      public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Index()      {          return View(await db.Employees.ToListAsync());      }        // GET: /Employee/Details/5      public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Details(int? id)      {          if (id == null)          {              return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);          }          Employee employee = await db.Employees.FindAsync(id);          if (employee == null)          {              return HttpNotFound();          }          return View(employee);      }        // GET: /Employee/Create      public ActionResult Create()      {          return View();      }        // POST: /Employee/Create      // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for       // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.      [HttpPost]      [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]      public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Create([Bind(Include=\"Id,Name,NickName,Designation,Dept\")] Employee employee)      {          if (ModelState.IsValid)          {              db.Employees.Add(employee);              await db.SaveChangesAsync();              return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");          }            return View(employee);      }        // GET: /Employee/Edit/5      public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Edit(int? id)      {          if (id == null)          {              return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);          }          Employee employee = await db.Employees.FindAsync(id);          if (employee == null)          {              return HttpNotFound();          }          return View(employee);      }        // POST: /Employee/Edit/5      // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for       // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.      [HttpPost]      [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]      public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Edit([Bind(Include=\"Id,Name,NickName,Designation,Dept\")] Employee employee)      {          if (ModelState.IsValid)          {              db.Entry(employee).State = EntityState.Modified;              await db.SaveChangesAsync();              return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");          }          return View(employee);      }        // GET: /Employee/Delete/5      public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Delete(int? id)      {          if (id == null)          {              return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);          }          Employee employee = await db.Employees.FindAsync(id);          if (employee == null)          {              return HttpNotFound();          }          return View(employee);      }        // POST: /Employee/Delete/5      [HttpPost, ActionName(\"Delete\")]      [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]      public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; DeleteConfirmed(int id)      {          Employee employee = await db.Employees.FindAsync(id);          db.Employees.Remove(employee);          await db.SaveChangesAsync();          return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");      }        protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)      {          if (disposing)          {              db.Dispose();          }          base.Dispose(disposing);      }  }    Step 7: Views – After selecting and executing template views are automatically created. Here is the views for CRUD operation of Employee.   Create.cshtml   @model MVCAsync.Models.Employee   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;   &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" /&gt;     &lt;title&gt;Create&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(\"Employee\", \"Index\", \"Employee\")&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  Step 9: Run the following command in package manager console one after another   PM&gt; Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName EmployeeDBContext PM&gt; Add-Migration created PM&gt; Update-Database –Verbose   Now run application and apply CRUD operation on it. It’s simple!!   ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","EF","C#"],

        "excerpt":"Introduction  You may introduce with an Object Oriented Design Principle name DRY – Don’t repeat yourself. It is more important in Multi-tier architecture. We can use generic repository pattern to implement DRY.   What is Repository Pattern?  In most of the business operation we have to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operation. A repository basically works as a mediator between our business logic layer and our data access layer of the application   Benefits of Repository Pattern      Centralizes data logic or service logic.   Provides a substitution point for the unit tests for both business logic and data access logic   Provides a flexible architecture   Can adopt new change easily   Domain driven development is easier   What is Generic Repository Pattern?  Generic Repository is a pattern by which we can use single repository for data access of all domain models. Generally, we used one repository for one model to access data.   Benefits of Generic Repository Pattern      Reduce redundancy of code   Force developer to work same pattern – Possibility of less error or no error   Easy to maintain – Centralize data access logic   Implementation Repository Pattern with ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework   Let’s consider a project to keep Employee Information. Here I will show CRUD operation on employee information.   Tools and Technology used I used following tools and technology to develop the project – Implementation of generic repository      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC 5   Entity Framework   Razor view engine   Step 1: Create an ASP.NET MVC 5 application using Visual Studio 2013.      Create an asp.net mvc project name - GenericRepo   Step 2: Configure connection string in web.config   &lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=GenericRepoDB;User ID=sa; Password=leads@123\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;   Step 3: Create Model – “Employee”   public class Employee {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }     public string FatherName { get; set; }     public string MotherName { get; set; }     public string Designation { get; set; }     public string Dept { get; set; } }    Step 4: Create a DbContext name GenericDbContext in Repository folder.   public class GenericRepoContext : DbContext {     public GenericRepoContext()         : base(\"DefaultConnection\")     {     }       public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }       protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)     {       } }   Step 5: Create IGenericRepository and GenericRepository in Repository folder   interface IGenericRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class {     IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; SelectAll();     T SelectByID(object id);     void Insert(T obj);     void Update(T obj);     void Delete(object id);     void Save(); }   public class GenericRepository&lt;T&gt; : IGenericRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class {     private GenericRepoContext db = null;     private DbSet&lt;T&gt; table = null;     public GenericRepository()     {         this.db = new GenericRepoContext();         table = db.Set&lt;T&gt;();     }     public GenericRepository(GenericRepoContext db)     {         this.db = db;         table = db.Set&lt;T&gt;();     }     public IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; SelectAll()     {         return table.ToList();     }     public T SelectByID(object id)     {         return table.Find(id);     }     public void Insert(T obj)     {         table.Add(obj);     }     public void Update(T obj)     {         table.Attach(obj);         db.Entry(obj).State = EntityState.Modified;     }     public void Delete(object id)     {         T existing = table.Find(id);         table.Remove(existing);     }     public void Save()     {         db.SaveChanges();     } }    Step 6: Create Employee Controller      Create a controller name – EmployeeController.   Select template “MVC5 Controller with read/write action”   public class EmployeeController : Controller {     private IGenericRepository&lt;Employee&gt; repository = null;     public EmployeeController()     {         this.repository = new GenericRepository&lt;Employee&gt;();     }         // GET: Employee     public ActionResult Index()     {         var employee = repository.SelectAll().ToList();         return View(employee);     }       // GET: Employee/Details/5     public ActionResult Details(int id)     {         var employee = repository.SelectByID(id);         return View(employee);     }       // GET: Employee/Create     public ActionResult Create()     {         return View();     }       // POST: Employee/Create     [HttpPost]     public ActionResult Create(Employee employee)     {         if (ModelState.IsValid)         {             repository.Insert(employee);             repository.Save();               return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");         }         return View(employee);     }       // GET: Employee/Edit/5     public ActionResult Edit(int id)     {         var employee = repository.SelectByID(id);         return View(employee);     }       // POST: Employee/Edit/5     [HttpPost]     public ActionResult Edit(Employee employee)     {         try         {             repository.Update(employee);             repository.Save();             return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");         }         catch         {             return View();         }     }       // GET: Employee/Delete/5     public ActionResult Delete(int id)     {         var employee = repository.SelectByID(id);         return View(employee);     }       // POST: Employee/Delete/5     [HttpPost]     public ActionResult Delete(int id, FormCollection collection)     {         try         {             repository.Delete(id);             repository.Save();             return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");         }         catch         {             return View();         }     } }   Step 7: Create List, Edit, Delete and details page against EmployeeController.      Right click on each action and add views   Index.cshtml   @model IEnumerable&lt;GenericRepo.Models.Employee&gt;   @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Index\"; }   &lt;h2&gt;Index&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;     @Html.ActionLink(\"Create New\", \"Create\") &lt;/p&gt; &lt;table class=\"table\"&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;th&gt;             @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt; model.Name)         &lt;/th&gt;         &lt;th&gt;             @Html.DisplayNameFor(model =&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;             @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.Name)         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;             @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.FatherName)         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;             @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.MotherName)         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;             @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.Designation)         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;             @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem =&gt; item.Dept)         &lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;             @Html.ActionLink(\"Edit\", \"Edit\", new { id=item.Id }) |             @Html.ActionLink(\"Details\", \"Details\", new { id=item.Id }) |             @Html.ActionLink(\"Delete\", \"Delete\", new { id=item.Id })         &lt;/td&gt;

        "excerpt":"What is Dependency Injection?  In software engineering, dependency injection is a software design pattern that implements inversion of control for resolving dependencies. – Wikipedia. It makes software components are loosely coupled.   Advantages of Dependency Injection      Flexibility to use alternative implementation of service.   Configurable &amp; easy to use   Make system loosely couple   Code becomes more reusable, testable, readable and manageable.   Reduction of boilerplate code in the application objects   What is Ninject?     Open Source Inversion of Control (IOC)   It is a Dependency Injector for .NET created by Nate Kohari   It’s very easy to use.   Easily add from nuget.   For more information visit Ninject.org   Let’s come to the implementation of DI using Ninject in ASP.NET MVC   Tools and Technology used  I used following tools and technology to develop the project –      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC 5   Entity Framework 6   Razor view engine   Ninject for MVC5   Step 1: Create a ASP.net MVC Project     From Visual studio 2013, choose File-&gt;Project   Select MVC Template and click OK   Step 2: Create a model name Employee   Create a Model name Employee in model folder   public class Employee {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }     public string Designation { get; set; }     public string Dept { get; set; }     public string BloodGroup { get; set; } }   Step 3: Change or Add Connection String      Change or Add connection string in Web.config ```xml           __Step 4: Create a Context class__ * Create HRMContext Class in Repository folder.   ```csharp public class HRMContext : DbContext {     public HRMContext()         : base(\"DefaultConnection\")     {     }     public DbSet &lt; Employee &gt; Employees { get; set; } }   Step 5: Create Repository Interface and Concrete Class     Create IEmployeeRepository Interface and EmployeeRepository class in Repository folder   public interface IEmployeeRepository : IDisposable {     IQueryable &lt;Employee&gt; All { get; }     Employee Find(int? id);     void InsertOrUpdate(Employee employee);     void Delete(int id);     void Save(); }     public class EmployeeRepository : IEmployeeRepository {       HRMContext context;     public EmployeeRepository(HRMContext context)     {         this.context = context;     }       public IQueryable &lt;Employee&gt; All     {         get { return context.Employees; }     }       public Employee Find(int? id)     {         Employee objEmployee = new Employee();         objEmployee = context.Employees.Where(p =&gt; p.Id == id).FirstOrDefault();         return objEmployee;     }       public void InsertOrUpdate(Employee employee)     {         if (employee.Id == default(int))         {             // New entity             context.Employees.Add(employee);         }         else         {             // Existing entity             context.Entry(employee).State = System.Data.Entity.EntityState.Modified;         }     }       public void Delete(int id)     {         var employee = context.Employees.Find(id);         context.Employees.Remove(employee);     }       public void Save()     {         context.SaveChanges();     }       public void Dispose()     {         context.Dispose();     } }    Step 6: Install Ninject from nuget      In nuget package manager search and install Ninject.MVC5   Step 7: Map Interface and Concrete class in Ninject     Go to NinjectWebCommon file in App_Start folder. Add the following line for IEmployee Interface and Employee concrete class.       public static class NinjectWebCommon      {         private static readonly Bootstrapper bootstrapper = new Bootstrapper();           /// &lt;summary&gt;         /// Starts the application         /// &lt;/summary&gt;         public static void Start()          {             DynamicModuleUtility.RegisterModule(typeof(OnePerRequestHttpModule));             DynamicModuleUtility.RegisterModule(typeof(NinjectHttpModule));             bootstrapper.Initialize(CreateKernel);         }                   /// &lt;summary&gt;         /// Stops the application.         /// &lt;/summary&gt;         public static void Stop()         {             bootstrapper.ShutDown();         }                   /// &lt;summary&gt;         /// Creates the kernel that will manage your application.         /// &lt;/summary&gt;         /// &lt;returns&gt;The created kernel.&lt;/returns&gt;         private static IKernel CreateKernel()         {             var kernel = new StandardKernel();             try             {                 kernel.Bind&lt;Func&lt;IKernel&gt;&gt;().ToMethod(ctx =&gt; () =&gt; new Bootstrapper().Kernel);                 kernel.Bind&lt;IHttpModule&gt;().To&lt;HttpApplicationInitializationHttpModule&gt;();                   kernel.Bind&lt;IEmployeeRepository&gt;().To&lt;EmployeeRepository&gt;();                   RegisterServices(kernel);                 return kernel;             }             catch             {                 kernel.Dispose();                 throw;             }         }           /// &lt;summary&gt;         /// Load your modules or register your services here!         /// &lt;/summary&gt;         /// &lt;param name=\"kernel\"&gt;The kernel.&lt;/param&gt;         private static void RegisterServices(IKernel kernel)         {         }             }   Step 8: Create Controller and Views     Click Right button on Controller Folder-&gt;Add Controller.   Choose its name as EmployeeController.   Now choose scaffolding template - Web API 2 Controller with actions, using Entity Framework.   After clicking Add button, Employee Controller and Corresponding actions and views will be created automatically.   Step 9: Modify the controller      Modify the controller - use repository instead of context directly.   public class EmployeesController : Controller {     private readonly IEmployeeRepository repository;       public EmployeesController(IEmployeeRepository objIrepository)     {         repository = objIrepository;     }       // GET: Employees     public ActionResult Index()     {         return View(repository.All.ToList());     }       // GET: Employees/Details/5     public ActionResult Details(int? id)     {         if (id == null)         {             return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);         }         Employee employee = repository.Find(id);         if (employee == null)         {             return HttpNotFound();         }         return View(employee);     }       // GET: Employees/Create     public ActionResult Create()     {         return View();     }       // POST: Employees/Create     // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for      // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.     [HttpPost]     [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]     public ActionResult Create([Bind(Include = \"Id,Name,Designation,Dept,BloodGroup\")] Employee employee)     {         if (ModelState.IsValid)         {             repository.InsertOrUpdate(employee);             repository.Save();             return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");         }           return View(employee);     }       // GET: Employees/Edit/5     public ActionResult Edit(int? id)     {         if (id == null)         {             return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);         }         Employee employee = repository.Find(id);         if (employee == null)         {             return HttpNotFound();         }         return View(employee);     }       // POST: Employees/Edit/5     // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for      // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.

        "excerpt":"Is it possible to create multiple DbContext in a single asp.net application with entity framework code first? Yes! Then, How!! This was the questions to me for a couple of weeks. Here is the simple article where you will get all answer. First, I want to say, yes it is possible to create multiple DbContext in a single asp.net application with entity framework code first.   Let’s see how to create multiple DbContext   Tools and Technology used  I used following tools and technology for my project –      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC 5   Entity Framework 6   Here, I have an application name PMTool with two DbContext name PMToolContext and SecurityContext.   Step 1: Enable Migration  If you run only Enable-Migrations in package manager console, you will get following error.   PM&gt; Enable-Migrations More than one context type was found in the assembly 'PMTool'. To enable migrations for 'PMTool.Repository.SecurityContext', use Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName PMTool.Repository.SecurityContext. To enable migrations for 'PMTool.Repository.PMToolContext', use Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName PMTool.Repository.PMToolContext.   So you have to run enable-migration for each context. You have to specify the directory for each Configuration.cs also. Now run the command in package manager console in the following way.   PM&gt; Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName PMToolContext -MigrationsDirectory Migrations\\PMToolContext Checking if the context targets an existing database... Code First Migrations enabled for project PMTool. PM&gt; Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName SecurityContext -MigrationsDirectory Migrations\\SecurityContext Checking if the context targets an existing database... Code First Migrations enabled for project PMTool.   Step 2: Add Migration  Use fully qualified name of the configuration class as follows.   PM&gt; Add-Migration -ConfigurationTypeName PMTool.Migrations.PMToolContext.Configuration FirstMigForPMTool Scaffolding migration 'FirstMigForPMTool'.   PM&gt; Add-Migration -ConfigurationTypeName PMTool.Migrations.SecurityContext.Configuration FirstMigForSecurity Scaffolding migration 'FirstMigForSecurity'.   Step 3: Update database   Now update the database. Use fully qualified name of configuration class here also.   PM&gt; Update-Database -ConfigurationTypeName PMTool.Migrations.PMToolContext.Configuration Specify the '-Verbose' flag to view the SQL statements being applied to the target database. Applying explicit migrations: [201512071619030_FirstMigForPMTool]. Applying explicit migration: 201512071619030_FirstMigForPMTool. Running Seed method. PM&gt; Update-Database -ConfigurationTypeName PMTool.Migrations.SecurityContext.Configuration Specify the '-Verbose' flag to view the SQL statements being applied to the target database. Applying explicit migrations: [201512071627058_FirstMigForSecurity]. Applying explicit migration: 201512071627058_FirstMigForSecurity. Running Seed method.   If each commands run individually, means you could use multiple DbContext in an asp.net web application with Entity framework. Let’s cheer!!  ","categories": ["ASP.NET","ASP.NET MVC","EF"],

        "excerpt":"What is OData?   OData Stands for Open Data Protocol. It is a data access protocol for the web. OData provides a uniform way to query and manipulate data sets through CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). OData consumption can be done across different Programming Language. ASP.NET Web API supports both OData v3 and V4.   Advantages of OData Services      OData based on REST Architecture so we can retrieve data using URL   Support CRUD Operation using HTTP Method like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE   Support HTTP, JSON and Atom Pub   It is very light weight, so interaction of client and server is very fast   Disadvantage      Since it is URL based so many people think it is less secure   It does not support all type of custom query   Let’s implement OData Services using ASP.NET Web API   Tools and Technology used  I used following tools and technology to develop the project –      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET Web API 2   Entity Framework 6   Postman(Google postman)   Step 1: Create a ASP.net Web API Project      Open visual studio and then go File -&gt; Project -&gt; ASP.NET Web Application   select Web API and press OK   Step 2: Install Microsoft.AspNet.Odata      Select Tool -&gt; NuGet Package Manager &gt; Package Manager Console   Type following command in package manager console     PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Odata          Step 3: Create a model class name Employee       Create a Model class name Employee in Model folder   public class Employee {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }     public string Designation { get; set; }     public string Dept { get; set; }     public string BloodGroup { get; set; } }   Step 4: Change or Add Connection String   Change or Add connection string in Web.config   &lt;add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"Data Source=(LocalDb)\\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\HRMDB.mdf;Initial Catalog=HRMDB;Integrated Security=True\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt;   Step 5: Create a Context class      Create HRMContext class in Model  folder.       public class HRMContext : DbContext   {       public HRMContext()           : base(\"DefaultConnection\")       {       }       public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }   }           Step 6: Add Employee Controller           Press right button on Controller folder -&gt; Add -&gt; Controller       Now choose “Web API 2 OData v3 Controller with actions, using Entity Framework” scaffolding template and then press Add.   Now choose Controller Name as EmployeeController, Model name as Employee and Context name as HRMContext and click Add.   The following code will be generated on corresponding for the controller.   public class EmployeeController : ODataController {     private HRMContext db = new HRMContext();       // GET: odata/Employee     [EnableQuery]     public IQueryable&amp;ltEmployee&amp;gt GetEmployee()     {         return db.Employees;     }       // GET: odata/Employee(5)     [EnableQuery]     public SingleResult&amp;ltEmployee&amp;gt GetEmployee([FromODataUri] int key)     {         return SingleResult.Create(db.Employees.Where(employee =&gt; employee.Id == key));     }       // PUT: odata/Employee(5)     public IHttpActionResult Put([FromODataUri] int key, Delta&lt;Employee&gt; patch)     {         Validate(patch.GetEntity());           if (!ModelState.IsValid)         {             return BadRequest(ModelState);         }           Employee employee = db.Employees.Find(key);         if (employee == null)         {             return NotFound();         }           patch.Put(employee);           try         {             db.SaveChanges();         }         catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)         {             if (!EmployeeExists(key))             {                 return NotFound();             }             else             {                 throw;             }         }           return Updated(employee);     }       // POST: odata/Employee     public IHttpActionResult Post(Employee employee)     {         if (!ModelState.IsValid)         {             return BadRequest(ModelState);         }           db.Employees.Add(employee);         db.SaveChanges();           return Created(employee);     }       // PATCH: odata/Employee(5)     [AcceptVerbs(\"PATCH\", \"MERGE\")]     public IHttpActionResult Patch([FromODataUri] int key, Delta&lt;Employee&gt; patch)     {         Validate(patch.GetEntity());           if (!ModelState.IsValid)         {             return BadRequest(ModelState);         }           Employee employee = db.Employees.Find(key);         if (employee == null)         {             return NotFound();         }           patch.Patch(employee);           try         {             db.SaveChanges();         }         catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)         {             if (!EmployeeExists(key))             {                 return NotFound();             }             else             {                 throw;             }         }           return Updated(employee);     }       // DELETE: odata/Employee(5)     public IHttpActionResult Delete([FromODataUri] int key)     {         Employee employee = db.Employees.Find(key);         if (employee == null)         {             return NotFound();         }           db.Employees.Remove(employee);         db.SaveChanges();           return StatusCode(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);     }       protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)     {         if (disposing)         {             db.Dispose();         }         base.Dispose(disposing);     }       private bool EmployeeExists(int key)     {         return db.Employees.Count(e =&gt; e.Id == key) &gt; 0;     } }    Step 7: Configure OData End Point      Open the file App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs.   Add the following references   using System.Web.Http.OData.Builder; using System.Web.Http.OData.Extensions; using Web.OData.Models;      Add the following code in the register method.     public static class WebApiConfig {   public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)   {     ODataConventionModelBuilder builder = new ODataConventionModelBuilder();     builder.EntitySet&lt;Employee&gt;(\"Employee\");     config.Routes.MapODataServiceRoute(\"odata\", \"odata\", builder.GetEdmModel());   } }           Step 8: Enable Migration      Type the following command in package manager console to enable migration     PM&gt; Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName HRMContext           After pressing enter you will see a class name Configuration is created in Mingrations folder with some codes.   Step 9: Add seed data and add migration      Modify the Seed() method of Configuration class like below to add some seed data.           protected override void Seed(Web.OData.Models.HRMContext context)         {               context.Employees.AddOrUpdate(               p =&gt; p.Name,               new Employee { Name = \"Mahedee Hasan\", Designation = \"Software Architect\", Dept = \"SSD\", BloodGroup = \"A+\" },               new Employee { Name = \"Kazi Aminur Rashid\", Designation = \"AGM\", Dept = \"SSD\", BloodGroup = \"NA\" },               new Employee { Name = \"Tauhidul Haque\", Designation = \"DGM\", Dept = \"SSD\", BloodGroup = \"A+\" }             );   }       Now type the following command in the package manager console to add a migration.   PM&gt; Add-Migration initialmigration   Step 10: Update database and attaché mdf file      Now type the following command in package manager console.     PM&gt; Update-Database –Verbose                You will see two file .mdf and .ldf is created in your App_data directory. Now attached the file to your application.       Now run you application.   Run Postman.   Type http://localhost:64126/odata/Employee in your postbox you will see following output in JSON format. Use port number on which your application currently running instead of 64126.      Now, it’s working…!! Cheers!!!   Source Code  ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","C#","Web API","OData"],

        "title": "ASP.NET Application Performance Tuning And Scalability Improvement (Part – 1)",
        "excerpt":"Every developers and customer wants his/her application performed well. But it is very tricky to improve performance of a web application. It’s actually depends on different parameter like HTML client, HTTP network, Web server, middle-tier components, database components, resource-management components, TCP/IP networks, and database servers. Sometimes performance of the application increases drastically, if you change a single parameter. Sometimes you have to change multiple parameters. Here are the some performance optimization tips for ASP.NET web applications which may help you to increase performance of ASP.NET Application.   Prepare release with release mode  When prepare release for deployment, select release mode instead of debug mode.   How affect in performance?      If you choose debug mode instead of release mode, you are creating pdb (program database – uses for debugging) files which creates extra overhead. For this reason you may face timeout problem.   Best Practice      Always prepare release in release mode.      In Web.Config, Set debug=”false”   Set debug=”false” in web.config as follows after deploying your application. By default debug=”true” when you create a web application. It is necessary to set debug=”true” in development environment.   &lt;system.web&gt;   &lt;compilation debug=\"false\" targetFramework=\"4.5.1\" /&gt; &lt;/system.web&gt;   How affect in performance?   If you set debug = “true”, application requires the pdb information to be inserted into the file and that results in a comparatively larger file and hence processing will be slow.   Best Practice   In deployment server, set debug = “false” in web.config   Turn off Tracing unless until required  Sometimes developers need to trace the application to monitor the executions of application or a pages. It requires for application diagnostic purposes.   How affect in performance?   When trace is enabled it loaded extra information to the pages which degrades performances.   Best Practice      Always set trace enabled = “false” unless or until you required to monitor a page’s executions. Set trace enable = “false” as follows in web.config.   &lt;system.web&gt;     &lt;trace enabled=\"true\" pageOutput=\"true\" requestLimit=\"10\" localOnly=\"false\" mostRecent=\"true\" traceMode=\"SortByTime\"/&gt; &lt;/system.web&gt;   Carefully manage session state Session state is a very useful feature of asp.net. Though, ASP.NET manages session state by default, we must pay attention of session memory management.   How affect in performance?     When you store your data in in-process or on a state server or in a SQL Database, session state, it requires memory.   It is also time consuming when you store or retrieve data in-process or state server or SQL server.   Best Practice           If your page is static, it is recommended not to use session state. In such cases where you don’t need to use session state, disable it on your web form using the following directive: &lt;@%Page EnableSessionState=”false”%&gt;            In case you use the session state only to retrieve data and not to update, make the session state read-only using the following directive. &lt;@%Page EnableSessionState =”ReadOnly”%&gt;            If your application session state is out of process then consider carefully whether there is a need of the state server or SQL Server mode. SQL Server session mode provides lower performance than state server mode.            Try to avoid keeping object in session. Since it requires serializing then de-serializing which affected in performance.            Use client-side state management than server side.       Disable View State of a page if not required      It stores data in the generated HTML using hidden field not on the server.   View State provides page level state management   As long as the user is on the current page, state is available and the user redirects to the next page and the current page state is lost   View State can store any type of data because it is object type but it is preferable not to store a complex type of data due to the need for serialization and deserialization on each post back   How affect in performance?      It increases the total payload of a page when submitted and when serving request.   Serialization and deserialization of the data is required when submitting data and gets requested data.   View state increases the memory allocations on the server.   Best Practice      Pages that do not have any server postback events can have the view state turned off.   The default behaviour of the View State property is enabled, but if you don’t need it, you can turn it off at the control or page level.   Within a control, simply set the EnableViewState property to false, or set it globally within the page using this setting.   &lt;%@ Page EnableViewState=\"false\" %&gt;   Use finally block to release resources We always uses try, catch and finally block for exception handling. Finally block executes whether any exception occurs or not.   How affect in performance?      Sometimes application occupy resources where as it doesn’t need it. It is occur due to bad programming.   Best Practice      Always use a finally block to release resources like closing database connections, closing files, disposing objects and other resources.   Avoid unnecessary round trips to the server   How affect in performance?      Unnecessary round trips significantly effect on web application performance.   It increases network latency and downstream server latency.   Many data-driven Web sites heavily access the database for every user request. While connection pooling helps, the increased network traffic and processing load on the database server can adversely affect performance.   Best Practice      Keep round trips as minimum as possible   Use Ajax or partial page load instead of full page reload or refresh.   Choose low cost authentication  Authentication is a main factor for a secured applications. You must take decision which authentication will you use? Keep in mind, passport authentication is slower than form-base authentication which is slower than Windows authentication.   Use paging in grid view  In asp.net web application to show data in tabular format, generally we use grid view. Besides this we also uses DataGrid, JQgrid, Telerik grid, Kendo Grid etc. For huge number of data we cannot think general way because it takes huge time to load.   Best Practice      To load grid view faster take advantages of paging, it shows small subsets of data at a time. JQGrid is faster than asp.net grid view because it does everything in client side.   Minimizes number of web server control   How affect in performance?      The uses of web server controls increase the response time.   Web server controls go to the server executes all of its life cycle and then rendered on the client side.   Best Practice      Don’t use server control unless until required. Use HTML elements where suited.   ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","C#"],

        "title": "Cascading Dropdown List In ASP.Net MVC A Sample Demonstration",
        "excerpt":"Last couple of weeks I found a good number of requests from my trainees and some .NET developers. They request me for sample code or a demonstration of cascading dropdown list in ASP.NET MVC. That’s why, I am writing this article. Cascading dropdown list is actually a parent child dropdown list. In this article I showed two dropdown lists one is category dropdown list and other is product dropdown list. Product dropdown list will be populated on the basis of category (selected category).   Let’s implement cascading dropdown list in ASP.NET MVC   Tools and Technology used  I used following tools and technology to develop the project –      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC 5   Entity Framework 6   JQuery Ajax   Step 1: Create a ASP.NET MVC Project     Open visual studio and then go   File -&gt; Project -&gt; ASP.NET Web Application   Create an ASP.NET MVC project   Step 2: Install Json.NET     Click right button on Project -&gt; NuGet Packages   Search Json.NET   Select and install Json.NET   Keep note that in this moment, your internet connection must on.   Step 3: Create a local database     Click right button on App_Data folder -&gt; Select Add -&gt; SQL Server Database.   Type Item name as InventoryDB. You can choose any type you want. You will see Inventory.mdf file is created in App_Data folder   Step 4: Modify connection string. Modify connection string as below because you are using localdb.   &lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"Data Source=(LocalDb)\\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\InventoryDB.mdf;Initial Catalog=InventoryDB;Integrated Security=True\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;   Step 5: Create a model for the application.   Create a model class name Category in model folder   public class Category {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }     public List&lt;Product&gt; Products { get; set; } }   Create a model class name Product in model folder   public class Product {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }       public int CategoryId { get; set; }       [ForeignKey(\"CategoryId\")]     public virtual Category Category { get; set; } }    Create a model name Item in model folder   public class Item {     public int Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }       [Display(Name = \"Category\")]     public int CategoryId { get; set; }     [ForeignKey(\"CategoryId\")]     public virtual Category Category { get; set; }       [Display(Name = \"Products\")]     public int ProductId { get; set; }     [ForeignKey(\"ProductId\")]     public Product Product { get; set; } }    Step 6: Create Context Class  Create a context class in model folder name InventoryDBContext as follows   public class InventoryDBContext : DbContext {     public InventoryDBContext()         : base(\"DefaultConnection\")     {       }       public DbSet&lt;Category&gt; Categories { get; set; }     public DbSet&lt;Product&gt; Products { get; set; }     public DbSet&lt;Item&gt; Items { get; set; } }    Step 7: Enable Migration      Go to Tools-&gt; NuGet Package Manager -&gt; Package Manger Console   Type the following command in package manager console to enable migration     PM&gt; Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName InventoryDBContext           After pressing enter you will see a class name Configuration is created in Migrations folder with some codes. Now add seed data in Seed method of Configuration class in Migrations folder as follows.   internal sealed class Configuration : DbMigrationsConfiguration&lt;Web.Mahedee.net.Models.InventoryDBContext&gt; {     public Configuration()     {         AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = false;     }       protected override void Seed(Web.Mahedee.net.Models.InventoryDBContext context)     {         context.Categories.AddOrUpdate(             p =&gt; p.Name,             new Category             {                 Name = \"Electronics\",                 Products = new List&lt;Product&gt; {                      new Product{Name = \"Mobile\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Laptop\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Television\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Camera\"}                 }               },               new Category             {                 Name = \"Men ware\",                 Products = new List&lt;Product&gt;                  {                      new Product{Name = \"Footware\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Clothings\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Watches\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Hand bag\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Sun Glass\"}                 }             },               new Category             {                 Name = \"Baby &amp; Kids\",                 Products = new List&lt;Product&gt;                  {                      new Product{Name = \"Baby footware\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Kids clothigs\"},                     new Product{Name = \"Baby care\"}                 }             },                new Category             {                 Name = \"Books\",                 Products = new List&lt;Product&gt;                  {                      new Product{Name = \"Introduction to C#\"},                     new Product{Name = \"ASP.NET MVC Begineer to Professional\"},                     new Product{Name = \"ASP.NET Web API Security\"},                     new Product{Name = \"SPA with ASP.NET MVC\"}                 }             }               );     } }    Step 8: Add Migration and Update database   In package manager console write the following command to add a migration.   PM&gt; add-migration firstmigration   A file will be created in Migrations folder something like below. File Name: 201512041037292_firstmigration   Update the file, in AddForeignKey section and set false for cascadeDelete as follows.   public partial class firstmigration : DbMigration  {      public override void Up()      {          DropForeignKey(\"dbo.Categories\", \"Item_Id\", \"dbo.Items\");          DropForeignKey(\"dbo.Products\", \"Item_Id\", \"dbo.Items\");          DropIndex(\"dbo.Categories\", new[] { \"Item_Id\" });          DropIndex(\"dbo.Products\", new[] { \"Item_Id\" });          CreateIndex(\"dbo.Items\", \"CategoryId\");          CreateIndex(\"dbo.Items\", \"ProductId\");            AddForeignKey(\"dbo.Items\", \"CategoryId\", \"dbo.Categories\", \"Id\", cascadeDelete: false);          AddForeignKey(\"dbo.Items\", \"ProductId\", \"dbo.Products\", \"Id\", cascadeDelete: false);            DropColumn(\"dbo.Categories\", \"Item_Id\");          DropColumn(\"dbo.Products\", \"Item_Id\");      }             public override void Down()      {          AddColumn(\"dbo.Products\", \"Item_Id\", c =&gt; c.Int());          AddColumn(\"dbo.Categories\", \"Item_Id\", c =&gt; c.Int());          DropForeignKey(\"dbo.Items\", \"ProductId\", \"dbo.Products\");          DropForeignKey(\"dbo.Items\", \"CategoryId\", \"dbo.Categories\");          DropIndex(\"dbo.Items\", new[] { \"ProductId\" });          DropIndex(\"dbo.Items\", new[] { \"CategoryId\" });          CreateIndex(\"dbo.Products\", \"Item_Id\");          CreateIndex(\"dbo.Categories\", \"Item_Id\");          AddForeignKey(\"dbo.Products\", \"Item_Id\", \"dbo.Items\", \"Id\");          AddForeignKey(\"dbo.Categories\", \"Item_Id\", \"dbo.Items\", \"Id\");      }  }    Write the following command in package manager console to update database.   PM&gt; update-database –Verbose   Step 9: Add Items Controller      Right click on Controllers folder -&gt; Add -&gt; Controller   Select MVC 5 Controller with views using Entity Framework and the click Add   Select Item as Model class and InventoryDBContext as context class and click Add button.   ItemsController and Views will be created automatically.   Step 10: Update Items controller   Modify the following action of Items controller   public ActionResult Create() {     List&lt;Category&gt; lstCategory = db.Categories.ToList();     lstCategory.Insert(0, new Category { Id = 0, Name = \"--Select Category--\" });       List&lt;Product&gt; lstProduct = new List&lt;Product&gt;();     ViewBag.CategoryId = new SelectList(lstCategory, \"Id\", \"Name\");     ViewBag.ProductId = new SelectList(lstProduct, \"Id\", \"Name\");     return View(); }    Add the following action in the Items controller   public JsonResult GetProductsByCategoryId(int id) {     List&lt;Product&gt; products = new List&lt;Product&gt;();     if (id &gt; 0)     {         products = db.Products.Where(p =&gt; p.CategoryId == id).ToList();       }     else     {         products.Insert(0, new Product { Id = 0, Name = \"--Select a category first--\" });     }     var result = (from r in products                   select new                   {                       id = r.Id,                       name = r.Name                   }).ToList();       return Json(result, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet); }    Step 5: Modify the Create View of Items folder  Modify the Create View as follows.    @model Web.Mahedee.net.Models.Item   @{     ViewBag.Title = \"Create\"; }   &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.1/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;     $(function () {         if ($(\"#CategoryId\").val() == '0') {             var productDefaultValue = \"&lt;option value='0'&gt;--Select a category first--&lt;/option&gt;\";             $(\"#ProductId\").html(productDefaultValue).show();         }           $(\"#CategoryId\").change(function () {             var selectedItemValue = $(this).val();               var ddlProducts = $(\"#ProductId\");             $.ajax({                 cache: false,                 type: \"GET\",                 url: '@Url.Action(\"GetProductsByCategoryId\", \"Items\")',                 data: { \"id\": selectedItemValue },                 success: function (data) {                     ddlProducts.html('');                     $.each(data, function (id, option) {                         ddlProducts.append($('&lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt;').val(option.id).html(option.name));                     });                 },                 error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {                     alert('Found error to load product!!.');                 }             });         });     }); &lt;/script&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;Create&lt;/h2&gt;     @using (Html.BeginForm()) {     @Html.AntiForgeryToken()       &lt;div class=\"form-horizontal\"&gt;         &lt;h4&gt;Item&lt;/h4&gt;         &lt;hr /&gt;         @Html.ValidationSummary(true, \"\", new { @class = \"text-danger\" })         &lt;div class=\"form-group\"&gt;             @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.CategoryId, \"Category\", htmlAttributes: new { @class = \"control-label col-md-2\" })             &lt;div class=\"col-md-10\"&gt;                 @Html.DropDownList(\"CategoryId\", null, htmlAttributes: new { @class = \"form-control\" })                 @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.CategoryId, \"\", new { @class = \"text-danger\" })             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;div class=\"form-group\"&gt;             @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.ProductId, \"Product\", htmlAttributes: new { @class = \"control-label col-md-2\" })             &lt;div class=\"col-md-10\"&gt;                 @Html.DropDownList(\"ProductId\", null, htmlAttributes: new { @class = \"form-control\" })                 @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.ProductId, \"\", new { @class = \"text-danger\" })             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;div class=\"form-group\"&gt;             @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; model.Name, htmlAttributes: new { @class = \"control-label col-md-2\" })             &lt;div class=\"col-md-10\"&gt;                 @Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.Name, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = \"form-control\" } })                 @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.Name, \"\", new { @class = \"text-danger\" })             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;div class=\"form-group\"&gt;             &lt;div class=\"col-md-offset-2 col-md-10\"&gt;                 &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Create\" class=\"btn btn-default\" /&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; }   &lt;div&gt;     @Html.ActionLink(\"Back to List\", \"Index\") &lt;/div&gt;   @section Scripts {     @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/jqueryval\") }    Now run the application and type the following URL . http://localhost:61767/Items/Create   You will see the following output.

        "title": "CRUD And Search Operation In ASP.NET MVC Application Using Partial View",
        "excerpt":"What is Partial View in ASP.NET MVC?      Partial view is a view which is rendered in another view   Partial view render portion of pages   Using partial view, you can reuse portion of page   Partial view is similar to a normal view with .cshtml   Project overview   Here I have created an application to keep basic employee information. View, add, update and delete option of an employee is in the application. I used partial view to show employee information in grid. Here I showed how do you run CRUD operation using partial view in most manageable way. Let’s come to the implementation of the project.   Tools and Technology used I used following tools and technology to develop the project –      Visual Studio 2013   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC 5   Entity Framework 6   Razor view engine   JQuery   Step 1: Create a ASP.net MVC Project     From Visual studio 2013, choose File-&gt;Project -&gt; ASP.NET Web application   Select MVC Template and click OK   Step 2: Change or Add Connection String     Change or Add connection string in Web.config as follows   &lt;add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"Data Source=(LocalDb)\\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\HRMDB.mdf;Initial Catalog=HRMDB;Integrated Security=True\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt;   Step 3: Create model classes   Create three model classes Dept, Designation and Employee as follows.   Dept Class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;   namespace Web.HRM.Models {     public class Dept     {         public Dept()         {             ActionDate = DateTime.Now;         }           [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Dept\")]         public string Name { get; set; }           public virtual List&lt;employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }         public DateTime ActionDate { get; set; }     } }   Designation Class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;   namespace Web.HRM.Models {     public class Designation     {         public Designation()         {             ActionDate = DateTime.Now;         }         [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }         [Display(Name = \"Designation\")]         public string Name { get; set; }         public virtual List&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }         public DateTime ActionDate { get; set; }       } }   Employee Class   using System; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;   namespace Web.HRM.Models {     public class Employee     {         public Employee()         {             ActionDate = DateTime.Now;         }           [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Employee Code\")]         public string EmpCode { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Full Name\")]         public string FullName { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Nick Name\")]         public string NickName { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Designation\")]         public int DesignationId { get; set; }           [ForeignKey(\"DesignationId\")]         public virtual Designation Designation { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Department\")]         public int DeptId { get; set; }           [ForeignKey(\"DeptId\")]         public virtual Dept Dept { get; set; }           public string Phone { get; set; }         public string Email { get; set; }         public string Address { get; set; }         public DateTime ActionDate { get; set; }     } }   Step 4: Create a Context class     Create HRMContext Class in Model folder.   using Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework; using System.Data.Entity;   namespace Web.HRM.Models {       public class HRMContext : IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;     {         public HRMContext()             : base(\"DefaultConnection\", throwIfV1Schema: false)         {         }           public static HRMContext Create()         {             return new HRMContext();         }           public DbSet&lt;Dept&gt; Depts { get; set; }         public DbSet&lt;Designation&gt; Designations { get; set; }         public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }     } }    Step 5: Create Controller and Views     Click Right button on Controller Folder-&gt;Add Controller.   Now choose MVC 5 Controller with views, using Entity Framework as scaffolding template.   Click Add.

                &lt;td&gt;                     &lt;input type=\"button\" value=\"Search\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" id=\"getData\" /&gt;                 &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;/table&gt;       &lt;/div&gt; }   @*&lt;div&gt;         @Html.ActionLink(\"Back to List\", \"Index\")     &lt;/div&gt;*@   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;div id=\"saveDiv\"&gt;     @{ Html.RenderAction(\"_LoadSearchEmployee\", new { desigId = \"\", deptId = \"\" }); } &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=\"partial\"&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;     @section Scripts {     @Scripts.Render(\"~/bundles/jqueryval\")         &lt;script&gt;         $(function () {               $('#getData').click(function () {                 //alert('Clicked');                 var deptId = $('#DeptSearch').val();                 var desigId = $('#DesigSearch').val();                 $('#saveDiv').hide();                   var url = \"@Html.Raw(Url.Action(\"_LoadSearchEmployee\", \"Employee\", new { desigId = \"-parameter\", deptId = \"sempar\" }))\";                 url = url.replace(\"-parameter\", desigId);                 url = url.replace(\"sempar\", deptId);                 $('#partial').load(url);             });           });       &lt;/script&gt; }    Step 9: Modify the RouteConfig     Modify route configuration in App_Start in RouteConfig.cs is as follows. Main reason to modify this class to run the create page by default.   using System.Web.Mvc; using System.Web.Routing;   namespace Web.HRM {     public class RouteConfig     {         public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)         {             routes.IgnoreRoute(\"{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}\");               routes.MapRoute(                 name: \"Default\",                 url: \"{controller}/{action}/{id}\",                 defaults: new { controller = \"Employee\", action = \"Create\", id = UrlParameter.Optional }             );         }     } }    Now run the application, you will see the following output. You can add, view, update and delete employee information in a same page. Thanks for your patience.     ","categories": ["ASP.NET MVC","C#"],

        "title": "Building A Simple Application Using ASP.NET Core 1.0",
        "excerpt":"What is .NET Core?      .NET Core is a general-purpose development platform   Maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub   Its work in cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux   Can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.   First release on 27 June, 2016   Application overview   HRM Core an application which I will develop here. User can view, add, edit and delete Employee information with his department and designation. This application will be developed by asp.net core. Let’s come to the implementation of the project.   Tools and Technology used I have used following tools and technology to develop the project –      Visual Studio 2015 Update 3   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC   Entity Framework core 1.0   Razor view engine   JQuery   Step 1: Create an ASP.net MVC Project          File -&gt; New project and select the project template C# -&gt; .NET Core -&gt; Console application (.NET Core).            Select Web Application as a Template, change authentication to individual user account and click OK          Step 2: Change or Add Connection String     Change or Add connection string in appsettings.json as follows   {   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=(localdb)\\\\mssqllocaldb;Database=HRMCoreDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true\"   },   \"Logging\": {     \"IncludeScopes\": false,     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Debug\",       \"System\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft\": \"Information\"     }   } }    Step 3: Create model classes   Create three model classes Dept, Designation and Employee as follows.   Dept Class  using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks;   namespace HRMCore.Models {     public class Dept     {         public Dept()         {             ActionDate = DateTime.Now;         }           //[Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int DeptId { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Dept\")]         public string Name { get; set; }           public string Location { get; set; }           public virtual List&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }         public DateTime ActionDate { get; set; }     } }    Designation Class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks;   namespace HRMCore.Models {     public class Designation     {         public Designation()         {             ActionDate = DateTime.Now;         }         [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }         [Display(Name = \"Designation\")]         public string Name { get; set; }         public virtual List&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }         public DateTime ActionDate { get; set; }     } }    Employee Class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks;   namespace HRMCore.Models {     public class Employee     {         public Employee()         {             ActionDate = DateTime.Now;         }           [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Employee Code\")]         public string EmpCode { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Full Name\")]         public string FullName { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Nick Name\")]         public string NickName { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Designation\")]         public int DesignationId { get; set; }           [ForeignKey(\"DesignationId\")]         public virtual Designation Designation { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Department\")]         public int DeptId { get; set; }           [ForeignKey(\"DeptId\")]         public virtual Dept Dept { get; set; }           public string Phone { get; set; }         public string Email { get; set; }         public string Address { get; set; }         public DateTime ActionDate { get; set; }     } }    Step 4: Modify Context class     Modify ApplicationDbContext in Data folder. Add DbSet for Dept, Designation and Employee model   using Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework; using System.Data.Entity;   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using HRMCore.Models;   namespace HRMCore.Data {     public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;     {         public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt; options)             : base(options)         {         }           public DbSet&lt;Dept&gt; Depts { get; set; }         public DbSet&lt;Designation&gt; Designations { get; set; }         public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }           protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)         {             base.OnModelCreating(builder);             // Customize the ASP.NET Identity model and override the defaults if needed.             // For example, you can rename the ASP.NET Identity table names and more.             // Add your customizations after calling base.OnModelCreating(builder);         }     } }   Step 5: Create Controller and Views Create Depts Controller and Views           Click Right button on Controller Folder-&gt;Add Controller. Now choose scaffolding template as MVC Controllers with views using Entity Framework and then Click Add.            Now select Model class as Dept and Data Context Class as ApplicationDbContext. Then click OK.       Create Employees Controller and Views          Click Right button on Controller Folder-&gt;Add Controller. Now choose scaffolding template as MVC Controllers with views using Entity Framework and then Click Add as before.            Then select Model class as Employee and Data Context Class as ApplicationDbContext as follows. Then click OK.       Step 6: Modify the controller     Modify EmployeeController as follows.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using HRMCore.Data; using HRMCore.Models;   namespace HRMCore.Controllers {     public class EmployeesController : Controller     {         private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;           public EmployeesController(ApplicationDbContext context)         {             _context = context;             }           // GET: Employees         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Index()         {             var applicationDbContext = _context.Employees.Include(e =&gt; e.Dept).Include(e =&gt; e.Designation);             return View(await applicationDbContext.ToListAsync());         }           // GET: Employees/Details/5         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Details(int? id)         {             if (id == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }               var employee = await _context.Employees.SingleOrDefaultAsync(m =&gt; m.Id == id);             if (employee == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }               return View(employee);         }           // GET: Employees/Create         public IActionResult Create()         {             ViewData[\"DeptId\"] = new SelectList(_context.Depts, \"DeptId\", \"Name\");             ViewData[\"DesignationId\"] = new SelectList(_context.Designations, \"Id\", \"Name\");             return View();         }           // POST: Employees/Create         // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for          // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.

        "title": "Image Cropping Using Jcrop In ASP.NET MVC Application",
        "excerpt":"What is Image cropping?      Image cropping refer to removal of some part of image   Uses to improve framing and size   Applied in photograph to resize image   Application overview  In this project, I will show image cropping of an employee phot when employee information saved and modified. Full crud operation applied in the application with image cropping.   Let’s have a look on the implementation of the project.   Tools and Technology used I have used following tools and technology to develop the project –      Visual Studio 2015   Visual C#   ASP.NET MVC   Entity Framework 5   Razor view engine   JCrop   Step 1: Create a ASP.net MVC Project          Select File -&gt; New project and select the project template Visual C# -&gt; ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)            Select MVC Template and click OK       Step 2: Change or Add Connection String  Change or Add connection string in Web.config as follows   &lt;connectionStrings&gt;   &lt;add name=\"DefaultConnection\" connectionString=\"Data Source=(LocalDb\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\JCropMVCDB.mdf;Initial Catalog=JCropMVCDB;Integrated Security=True\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" /&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;   Step 3: Install JCrop Nuget Package  Go to Tools -&gt; NuGet Package Manager -&gt; Manages NuGet Package Manager for the solution -&gt; Search Jcrop and install jquery.jcrop.js      Step 4: Create model class   Create model class “Employee” as follows.   Employee Class   using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;   namespace JCropMVC.Models {     public class Employee     {         [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Full Name\")]         [Required(ErrorMessage = \"Name cannot be empty\")]         public string Name { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Father Name\")]         public string FatherName { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Designation\")]         public string Designation { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Mobile No\")]         public string Mobile { get; set; }           [DataType(DataType.EmailAddress)]         [Display(Name = \"Email\")]         public string Email { get; set; }           [Display(Name = \"Image URL\")]         public string PhotoURL { get; set; }     } }    Step 5: Modify Context class     Modify ApplicationDbContext in IdentityModel Class   public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; {     public ApplicationDbContext()         : base(\"DefaultConnection\", throwIfV1Schema: false)     {     }       public static ApplicationDbContext Create()     {         return new ApplicationDbContext();     }       public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; } }    Step 6: Create Controller and Views     Create Employees Controller and Views   Click Right button on Controller Folder-&gt;Add Controller. Now choose scaffolding template as MVC Controllers with views using Entity Framework and then Click Add.   Now select Model class as Employee and Data Context Class as ApplicationDbContext and click OK.   Step 7: Modify the controller     Modify EmployeesController as follows. Here method ProcessImage(string croppedImage) is used to process and save image. An extra parameter added for Create and Edit action.   using System; using System.Data.Entity; using System.Linq; using System.Net; using System.Web.Mvc; using JCropMVC.Models; using System.IO;   namespace JCropMVC.Controllers {     public class EmployeesController : Controller     {         private ApplicationDbContext db = new ApplicationDbContext();           // GET: Employees         public ActionResult Index()         {             return View(db.Employees.ToList());         }           // GET: Employees/Details/5         public ActionResult Details(int? id)         {             if (id == null)             {                 return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);             }             Employee employee = db.Employees.Find(id);             if (employee == null)             {                 return HttpNotFound();             }             return View(employee);         }           // GET: Employees/Create         public ActionResult Create()         {             return View();         }           // POST: Employees/Create         // To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for          // more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.

        "title": "Easy Solution On How to Stop Growing Log File Too Big",
        "excerpt":"In various organizations, huge SQL databases are equipped, which perform more than millions of transactions per hour. A SQL server database has data files and transaction log files. Data files store the user data and transaction log files store all the changes user made in the database and all the details of the transactions performed while making changes.   Now, the issue is that this feature of logging the details, every time changes are made in SQL server can not be controlled or stopped. This causes a grave issue when the size of SQL server overgrows. However, the way in which these log files grow and configure can be controlled. So, to avoid SQL server log file growing unexpectedly, consider any of the following methods given below. Also, to manage the large area size, it is good to shrink log file size, we will discuss the ways to resolve the same issue in this content.   SQL Server- Solutions To Stop Growing Log File Too Big   There are numerous ways for truncating sql ldf too big file. Some of the chief solutions have been provided in the following segment of this content.           Monitor default Size Limit: In case SQL ldf file is growing too big then, put a large default size limit on the SQL server, so that it does not expands automatically and overloads the SQL server database.            Using the Memory Units: Remember to configure the expansion of log files by making use of the memory units instead of percentage if the SQL transaction log file grows quickly.            Changing the recovery model: Simple Recovery model definitely helps in controlling and shrinking the log file size. Based on how crucial the data is, user can choose any of the following recovery models namely,      1. Simple Recovery Model      2. Bulk-logged Recovery Model      3. Full Recovery Model       In the simple model, the most recent backup of the database of SQL server is recovered while in the bulk-logged or full recovery model, database can be recovered up to the point of failure. This recovery is done by restoring transaction log file.   By default, Full recovery model is set. Then, user has to regularly back up the transaction log files to prevent them from becoming too large and to remove inactive transactions from transaction log. Also, consider this when taking back up of .ldf files.   NOTE: If user is defragmenting indexes, make use of DBCC INDEXDEFRAG and not DBCC DBREINDEX. If DBCC DBREINDEX is used then, transaction log file might expand drastically.   Using Manual Solution:   If maintenance is not carried on regularly, log file size grows too big. Therefore, it is recommended to take these manual steps before it takes up all available disk space. Now, let us look at the method to shrink a SQL Database’s transaction log file:      Firstly, Open the SQL Server Management Studio and then log in to the proper SQL instance.   In Object Explorer tree, expand the Database folder » select database with large .ldf file.   After this, Create a full backup of database by right-clicking on it » Select Tasks » Back Up.            User should make sure that Backup type is set to Full then, Delete any existing destinations » add a new Disk destination.       Browse a location with a lot of free disk space » rename the backup file with the .BAK extension.       Choose the bullet option for Overwrite all existing backup sets on the ‘Options’ page.       Finally, user can click on the ‘OK’ button to start the process of taking backup of log files.           Similarly, create a transaction log backup of the database in the same manner as done above.            Right-click on database » Select Tasks » Backup and assure that backup type is set to Transaction log.       Choose the bullet option for Overwrite all existing backup sets on the ‘Options’ page.       Finally, user can click on the ‘OK’ button to start the process of taking backup of log files.           The closing step is the shrinking of transaction log files by right-clicking database » Tasks » Shrink » Files   NOTE: User may repeat steps 3,4 and 5 until the .ldf file size becomes physically smaller.   Conclusion   In this content, we have discussed various solutions on how to truncate .ldf files if transaction file size becomes too large. This is necessary in order to manage data with ease. Manual method and some general solutions have been written in this content to enlighten users when they come across such issues while dealing with SQL Server.  ","categories": ["SQL Server"],

Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining. (Wikipedia) Azure Machine Learning Studio is a tool that uses to develop predictive analytic solutions in the Microsoft Azure Cloud.  Experiment Overview  Azure Machine Learning Studio is an excellent tool to develop and host Machine Learning Application. You don’t need to write code. You can develop an experiment by drag and drop. Here we will create a simple Machine Learning experiment using Azure Machine Learning Studio.  Tools and Technology used   Azure Machine Learning Studio  Now create our experiment step by step  Step 1: Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace   Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in using your azure credential Click More Services from left panel of azure portal Click “Machine Learning Studio Workspace” under “Intelligence + Analytics” category Add a work space by clicking add (+) button at the top left corner Choose pricing tire and select. Figure shows pricing tire below. Finally click create button      Step 2: Launch Machine Learning Studio   Click Launch Machine Learning Studio to launch machine learning studio Then login to the portal    Step 3: Create a blank experiment   Select Experiment Menu. Then click New (+), at the bottom left corner. Click Blank Experiment. In addition to blank experiment there are many other sample experiments. You can load and modify the experiment. Once the new blank experiment has been loaded, you will then see the Azure ML Studio visual designer as follows.      Step 4: Add data set in the ML Studio visual designer   You can import data set or can use saved data set. In this case we use saved sample dataset. Click Saved Datasets from left top corner. Drag and drop “Adult Census Income Binary Classification dataset” from Saved Datasets -&gt; Sample    Step 5: Select columns in dataset   Expand Data Transformation -&gt; Manipulation Drag and drop “Select Columns in Dataset” to the visual surface Connect the “Dataset” with “Select Columns in Dataset” in visual surface Click the Select Columns in Dataset Click Launch column selector in the property pane Select “WITH RULES” Add age, education, marital-status, relationship, race, sex, income columns and finally click tick mark of the bottom right corner.      Step 6: Split up the dataset   Split your input data into two – Training data and Validation data Expand “Data Transformation” -&gt; “Sample and Split” from left pane Drag and drop Split Data to Azure Machine Learning Studio visual surface Connect the split module with “Select Columns in Dataset” in visual surface Click the Split module and set the value of the Fraction of Rows to 0.80 in the right pane of the visual designer surface. This means 80 percent data will be used for training and rest of the data will be used for validation.    Step 7: Train the model   Expand “Machine Learning” -&gt; “Train” from left pane Drag and drop “Train Model” to Azure ML Studio visual surface Connect split dataset1 to train model (second point of train model as figure below) Expand Machine Learning -&gt; Initialize Model -&gt; Classification from left pane Drag and drop “Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree” as shown figure Connect “Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree” to Train Model (first point of train model as figure below)    Step 8: Choose columns for prediction   Click the Train Model Click “Launch column selector” in the property pane Select Include and add column name “Income”. Because this experiment will predict income. Click tick mark on the bottom right corner    Step 9: Score the model   Expand “Machine Learning” -&gt; “Score” Drag and drop “Score Model” to the visual design surface. Connect Train Model to Score Model (first point of Score Model as figure below) Connect “Split” to “Score Model” (second point of Split with Second point of Score Model as figure below)    Step 10: Evaluate the model   Expand “Machine Learning” -&gt; “Evaluate” Drag and drop “Evaluate Model” to the visual design surface. Connect “Score Model” to “Evaluate Model” (first point of Evaluate Model as figure below) Now click “Run” at the bottom of the Azure ML Studio. After processing, if you see each stage marked as green, means its ok. After completing process, right click on the Evaluate Model -&gt; Evaluation Result -&gt; Visualize You will see the accuracy curve as shown below. Click Save As at the bottom of the screen        Step 11: Setup a web service   Click Setup Web Service -&gt; Predictive Experiment Connect Web Service Input to Score model (As shown below figure) Select “Column in Dataset”, remove income column from dataset. Because model is now ready to predict income. Save and run the model from bottom of the ML studio        Step 12: Deploy Web Service   Click Deploy Web Service -&gt; Deploy Web Service [Classic] from the bottom of ML Studio After completing deployment process, you will see a dashboard. Here you will see different documents to test and consume services as shown below Click “Test Button” from the Dashboard You will see a popup dialog to take input Type input as like below and Click Tick mark You will see desired output as like figure. Here you see income &gt; 50K        Now you have developed a simple data science experiment. You can now embed this with your application. API links, security key and necessary document is given in the dashboard.                                     &lt;/option&gt;&lt;/form&gt;                        Go                                                                                       &copy; 2021 GitHub, Inc.

        "title": "How to Get Rid of SQL Server Error 3313, 3314 & 3414",
        "excerpt":"Overview   Microsoft SQL Server is Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). The primary function of this software product is storing and retrieving data as per request of other software applications installed on the same or other computers across a network (including the Internet). Just like other computer applications, SQL Server also incorporates some error messages with it. In this technical paper, we are going to discuss some common SQL Server errors and the techniques to resolve them easily. So, let us get started!   SQL Server Error 3313  Description: ‘Could not redo log record’ error occurs in SQL Server while redoing of a logged operation in database ‘%. This error occurs at log record ID %S_LSN. The particular failure is previously logged as the error in the Windows Event Log Service. This error places the database into a SUSPECT state. Error 3313 in SQL Server requires to restore the database from full backup or repair the entire database.   Note: The database cannot be recovered during the startup of SQL Server.   Resolution: Below are some solutions to Microsoft SQL Server error 3313.   Technique 1: Run Hardware Diagnostics   First, run the hardware diagnostics to correct all issue. Also, examine that the Microsoft Windows NT system, application log, and SQL Server log to find out the cause of hardware failure.   If there is persistent data inconsistency problems then, try to swap out various hardware components to isolate the issue. Make sure that write caching is not enabled on disk controller of your system. If you suspect that, this is the problem then, contact the hardware vendor.   Eventually, you may find it beneficial to switch to a new hardware system, including reformatting disk drives and re-installing the OS.   Technique 2: Restore from Backup   If the issue is not related to hardware and a complete backup is available then, restore the database from recent backup.   Technique 3: Run DBCC CHECKDB Command   If the backup is not available then, execute DBCC CHECKDB command without the repair clause to recognize the level of corruption. DBCC CHECKDB command is recommended to repair the corrupted database.   SQL Server Error 3314  Description: It is a rollup error to undo the recovery process. It occurs while undoing a logged operation in database ‘%. It occurs in log record ID %S_LSN. It places the database into the SUSPECT state. The primary and other filegroups are suspect and might be damaged. One can recover the database or file from the backup or can repair the database.   Resolution: First workaround to fix SQL Server error 3314 is restore the database from backup. The server is recommended to use the current backup file to restore the SUSPECT database. However, if the backup is not available then, go to the following solution:      Execute DBCC CHECDB command as an emergency repairing technique. For this run the below mentioned command:     ALTER DATABASE SET EMERGENCY          After setting the database to emergency mode, try to copy or move whole data (as much possible) to another database.       SQL Server Error 3414  ‘SQL Server service not starting: Error Code 3414’ is an error message that occurs while logging in or start-up time when the automatic recovery of SQL database is not completed properly. This error is stated as follows:      Note:The description of error 3414 can be found in the Event Log or ERRORLOG entry of SQL Server, while the database attempts recovery procedure and fails to do the same.   If SQL Server finds it hard to recuperate the scheduled database from a suspicious condition the error 3414 occurs. If the database recovery from SQL error 3414 becomes failed, this will update ‘sys.databases.state_desc’ and ‘SQL Server Management Studio’ both column status as a SUSPECT.   Resolution: The error message 3414 provides two choices:      “Restore from a recent good backup”   “Diagnose the recovery error and fix them”   Yet, to fix the issue, the alternative to restore from complete backup is good in some cases but if it is not possible; try the following alternatives:      Utilize the Database Console Commands, rather ’emergency repair’ procedure provided by DBCC CHECKDB   Copy the healthy or recoverable data to another database Note: Via above-mentioned technique, the operational consistency is not guaranteed.   Quick Tip: SQL Error 3313, 3314 and 3414 make database in Suspect Mode and you will not be able to access your database. To resolve these error quickly, you can use SQL Recovery Software for easy repairing of your database.   Summing It Up In this article, we have discussed some easy techniques for troubleshooting error 3313, 3314, 3414 in SQL Server. It is recommended to execute the guidelines sequentially and carefully to avoid any kind of data loss condition or you can opt for a quick solution ie SQL Recovery Tool to recover database from Suspect Mode.

        "title": "Fix SQL Error 924 Without Any Data Loss – Most Accurate Way",
        "excerpt":"SQL Server is Microsoft’s relational database management system(RDBMS). It is used to primarily stores and retrieves data requested by other application. It is a programming language developed to handle data in a relational database management system. It is known that a database server is a computer program which provides database services to other programs and defined as a client-server model. Hence, the SQL Server is a database server that is used to implement the Structured Query Language (SQL). Due to its platform independence, it can be functioned on both GUI and command based software.   Similar to other applications, SQL Server also prompts different types of error. It is mostly encountered by an individual user or a system administrator. One such error is “SQL error 924” or “Msg 924 Database is already open and can only have one user at a time”. This blog mentions the reasons for SQL error code 924 and its possible solutions.   User Queries  Let us take a glance for the various error messages which appear in an SQL Server. These queries have been taken from various tech-forums which are relevant to SQL error code 924. Some of them are mentioned below:   “During the execution course to restore project command in SQL Server Management Studio. I encountered an error “Exclusive access could not be obtained because the database is in use”.Then, I went to the database properties and switched to Single User mode. After which, I am unable to switch it back to multi-user mode. I get the error message “Msg 924 Database is already open and can only have one user at a time.” Would I be able to solve this error, please help!”   “When I tried to open the SQL database “AdventureWorks” in a single user mode, an error message was displayed stating, Database ‘AdventureWorks’ is already open and can only have one user at a time. It is a Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 924. Is there any troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue?”   SQL Error Code 924 – Find Out The Root Cause  Microsoft SQL error 924 generally occurs whenever an attempt is been made to access the database by another user which is set as a single-user mode. Hence, only one user can access the database at a time when it is set to single-user mode.   Manual Techniques To Solve SQL Error 924          Restore the Database from Backup  A user can restore the database by using a backup. To practice this method, make sure there is an updated backup for the same. If there is no current database, try using another method.            Check SQL Server Services  There could be settings failure in the Server Services that might result this issue. Hence, it is advised to restart the SQL Server service, which may solve the problem. If the problem still exists, try to use SQL Server Configuration Manager.            DBCC CHECKDB Repair Options  One can repair the database using the following options, where “abc” is the database name,       DBCC CHECKDB(‘abc‘,REPAIR_REBUILD)   If it does not work, try using this,  DBCC CHECKDB(‘abc‘,REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS)            Verify the Database Accessed is in Single-User Mode              Firstly, check the status of the database by executing the command below:           sp_helpdb   go   Note: If the database is in single mode, it is shown as “single user” in the status column      Now, execute sp_who to find out who is accessing the database. From there, check the database name under dbname column and the login name from the loginame column   Either contact the system administrator “sa” or the individual to arrange the database access. The “sa” or database owner “dbo” can set the database to give multi-user access. Make sure the database is not in use which is followed as,   sp_dboption , single, false  go  use   go checkpoint go   Repair SQL Error 924- An Automated Approach  SQL Error 924 is one of the common error faced by a majority of system administrators and individuals. With the manual approach, one can fix this issue but there are less chances that it repair the error completely. Hence, it is recommended to use SQL Repair tool. It is the most preferred software to fix different types of SQL errors, including SQL error 924. It offers two scanning modes to scan more effectively i.e., Quick scan and advanced scan. With its easy-to-use interface, no technical knowledge is required to use this software.   Conclusion  While working with SQL server, an error can occur anytime. One such error is SQL error 924 which can be fixed by using the above manual technique. However, it is observed that the manual approach mostly fails. This can be resolved using third party utility which enables to repair SQL errors and even support to the latest SQL server 2016 version.

        "title": "Top 2 Methods To Recover Deleted Records From SQL Table",
        "excerpt":"When it comes to data management task, SQL Server is used by most of IT organizations. Sometimes, while working with table users perform UPDATE operation or DELETE operation accidentally without specifying the WHERE condition. This results in the deletion of the SQL table. Now, it becomes difficult for an organization to handle the data loss problem. Fortunately, it is possible to recover deleted records from SQL table. Thus, in this blog, we are going to introduce different ways to recover deleted table record in SQL Server.   How To Recover Deleted Records From SQL Table?  Each record present in the SQL Server transaction log is uniquely identified by a log sequence number (LSN). The user can recover deleted rows if the time of their deletion is known. This can be done only through the use of Log Sequence Number (LSNs). Basically, the LSN of a log record at which a significant event occurred can be useful for constructing correct restore sequences.   Recover Deleted Records From SQL Table – Step-By-Step Process  In this section, we are going to explain the process to recover deleted records from SQL table with the help of Transaction log and LSNs.   Step - 1. First of all, you have to check the number of rows present in the table from which the data has been mistakenly deleted via using the below-mentioned query:   SELECT * FROM Table_name   Step - 2. Now, you need to take the transaction log backup of the database by implementing the query given below:   USE Databasename GO BACKUP LOG [Databasename] TO DISK = N'D:\\Databasename\\RDDTrLog.trn' WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT, NAME = N'Databasename-Transaction Log Backup', SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD, STATS = 10 GO   Step - 3. After that, to recover deleted records from SQL Server Table, gather some information related to deleted rows. For this, you need to execute the query given below:   USE Databasename GO Select [Current LSN] LSN], [Transaction ID], Operation, Context, AllocUnitName FROM fn_dblog(NULL, NULL) WHERE Operation = 'LOP_DELETE_ROWS'   After executing all the above-mentioned queries, the user will obtain a Transaction ID (assuming ID is 000:000001f3) of the deleted row. Now, the user can easily determine the time when these rows were deleted via using this ID.   Step-4. To find the particular time at which rows were deleted you need to use the transaction ID 000:000001f3. You have to follow the query given below:   USE Databasename GO SELECT [Current LSN], Operation, [Transaction ID], [Begin Time], [Transaction Name], [Transaction SID] FROM fn_dblog(NULL, NULL) WHERE [Transaction ID] = ‘000:000001f3' AND [Operation] = 'LOP_BEGIN_XACT'   After executing this query, you will get the value of current Log Sequence Number (LSN). Assuming the value is 00000020:000001d0:0001   Step - 5. Next, begin the restore process to recover deleted records from SQL table:   USE Databasename GO RESTORE DATABASE Databasename_COPY FROM DISK = 'D:\\Databasename\\RDDFull.bak' WITH MOVE 'Databasename' TO 'D:\\RecoverDB\\Databasename.mdf', MOVE 'Databasename_log' TO 'D:\\RecoverDB\\Databasename_log.ldf', REPLACE, NORECOVERY; GO   Step - 6. Now, apply the transaction log to restore deleted rows by using LSN 00000020:000001d0:0001   USE Databasename  GO RESTORE LOG Databasename_COPY FROM DISK = N'D:\\Databasename\\RDOTrLog.trn' WITH STOPBEFOREMARK = ‘lsn:0x00000020:000001d0:0001' Note: Since LSN values are in HexadecimaUSE Databasename GO  RESTORE LOG Databasename_COPY FROM DISK = N'D:\\Databasename\\RDOTrLog.trn' WITH STOPBEFOREMARK = ‘lsn:0x00000020:000001d0:0001'  Note: Since LSN values are in Hexadecimal form and for restoring tables using this LSN, we need to convert it into decimal form. For this purpose, we add 0x just before the LSN as shown above form and for restoring tables using this LSN, we need to convert it into decimal form. For this purpose, we add 0x just before the LSN as shown above   Step - 7. Finally, the process to recover the deleted table from SQL Server will begin. After the completion of the process, you can easily check for the SQL table in the database   USE Databasename_Copy GO Select * from Table_name   Recover Deleted Records From SQL Table  However, it is quite difficult for the user to implement the steps correctly. As the method is highly time-consuming and requires adequate technical knowledge. Additionally, if the user is not able to perform the steps correctly then it can also lead to permanent data loss issues. Thus, to avoid all the catastrophic situations, the user can make use of an automated solution that is SysTools SQL Log Viewer. With SQL Log Analyzer, the user can easily recover deleted records from SQL Server if the database is in simple recovery mode. Moreover, the utility can also read and analyze all the transaction like INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE etc. The software is capable to preview .ldf activities such as transaction, time, name, table name, query etc.      Final Words  Every organization or businesses own important and confidential data. Thus, no one can afford the loss of their vital data. To manage tons of data, SQL Server database is used by numerous companies and users. Sometimes, the situation arises in which the user by mistake deletes SQL table. Now, recovering deleted SQL table is quite a complex task for the user without knowing the proper approach. Thus, in the above section, we have introduced a complete procedure to recover deleted records from SQL table.   Author: Andrew Jackson  ","categories": ["SQL Server","Database"],

        "title": "Factory Design Pattern using C#",
        "excerpt":"Factory design pattern implements the concept of real world factories. Factory pattern is a creational design pattern. It deals with creating object without specifying exact class. In general, actors of factory patterns are a client, a factory and a product. Client is an object that requires another object for some purposes. Rather than creating the product instance directly, the client delegates this responsibility to the factory. The factory then creates a new instance of the product, passing it back to the client. Figure shows the whole process.      Application   For an example, a banking application works with accounts. In this application there are different types of account like saving account and checking account. All accounts are derived from an abstract account name IAccount. The IAccount defines the withdraw, deposit and interest rate which must be implemented by the concrete accounts (saving account, checking account). If clients want to know the interest rate of the Saving Account. It just invoke the factory to create an instance of Saving account.  Being invoked factory, it creates an instance of the saving account and then client just get the interest rate by invoking interest method. The client uses the object as casted to the abstract class without being aware of the concrete object type. Over all implementation of this scenario is given below.   The advantage is in here that new account can be added without changing a single line of code in the client code. Here an object is created without exposing instantiation logic to the client. The object generation is centralized here.   Benefits:      Factory Pattern is the mostly used pattern.   Decoupled the classes i.e eliminates the need to bind application specific class   The code only deals with the Interface.   Factory Pattern provides the way to create multiple instances of classes.   This provides a hook so that we can derive a sub-class to create different controls to display the data.   Factory method connects the class hierarchies with minimum coupling.   Product implementation may change over time but client remains unchanged.   Implementation   Step 1: Create an Interface - IAccount   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace FactoryPattern {   public interface IAccount   {     string Withdraw(int amount);     string Deposit(int amount);          double InterestRate();   } }   Step 2: Create concrete classes   Saving account   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace FactoryPattern {     /// Concrete class SavingsAccount     public class SavingsAccount : IAccount     {         public string Withdraw(int amount)         {           throw new NotImplementedException();         }                  public string Deposit(int amount)         {           throw new NotImplementedException();         }                  public double InterestRate()         {           return 12.5;         }     } }    Checking Account   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace FactoryPattern {          ///     /// Concrete class CheckingAccount     ///          public class CheckingAccount : IAccount     {         public string Withdraw(int amount)         {             throw new NotImplementedException();         }                  public string Deposit(int amount)         {             throw new NotImplementedException();         }                  public double InterestRate()         {             return 10.24;         }              } }   Step 3: Create a Factory Object Enum   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace FactoryPattern {     /// FactoryObject Enum to configure object     public enum FactoryObject     {         SavingAccount,         CheckingAccount     } }   Step 4: Create a factory class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace FactoryPattern {     ///     /// Factory class to create object     ///          public static class Factory     {         public static IAccount CreateObject(FactoryObject factoryObject)         {             IAccount objIAccount = null;                          switch (factoryObject)             {                 case FactoryObject.SavingAccount:                 objIAccount = new SavingsAccount();                 break;                                  case FactoryObject.CheckingAccount:                 objIAccount = new CheckingAccount();                 break;                                  default:                 break;             }                          return objIAccount;         }     } }    Step 5: Access from client   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace FactoryPattern {     public class Program     {         public static void Main(string[] args)         {             //Create object by factory pattern             IAccount objSavingAccount = Factory.CreateObject(FactoryObject.SavingAccount);             IAccount objCheckingAccount = Factory.CreateObject(FactoryObject.CheckingAccount);                          //Access object             Console.WriteLine(\"Saving Account Interest Rate: \" + objSavingAccount.InterestRate());             Console.WriteLine(\"Checking Account Interest Rate: \" + objCheckingAccount.InterestRate());                          Console.ReadLine();                  }     } }   Source code  ","categories": ["OOP","C#","Design Pattern"],

        "excerpt":"Abstract factory pattern is a creational design pattern. Creational design pattern is deals with object creation mechanism. Object creation mechanism is changed on the basis of problem. Abstract factory pattern provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class. It is identified on the basis of problem complexity. It is encapsulated the process of instantiation of family of classes. Abstract factory pattern is widely used in framework and libraries to encapsulate the family of classes.   Elements of Abstract Factory Pattern:      Abstract Factory – An Interface to create families of related or dependent item object.   Concrete Factory – Implement the interface to create families of related item object.   Abstract Item – An interface to create concrete item object.   Concrete Item – Implement the interface to create concrete item object.   Client – Uses Interface (abstract Item) provided by abstract factory and access concrete object by this interface.

        "excerpt":"Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern. It is a particular software design pattern where algorithms are selected at runtime.   According to the book of Design Pattern (Gang of Four) - “Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. “   The key phrases of definition are “Family of algorithms”, “encapsulate”, and “interchangeable”. Actually, Strategy Pattern encapsulates a collection of functions that do similar yet not identical jobs. Client is not bound to call fixed methods; rather it can change its strategy dynamically at run time. Client don’t call any methods directly by instantiating concrete classes. It sets its strategy via context class.   There are three main parts in strategy pattern:      Strategy – An interface that defines how the algorithm will be called.   Concrete Strategy – The implementation of the strategy.   Context – It holds the concrete strategy.      Implementation:   Suppose you have two lists of items. Item here integer numbers. Now, if you want to search an item from either of the lists. You can use either one of the algorithms from Linear Search or Binary search. Since binary search algorithm cannot search data without sorted list, we take here a sorted list. Now the strategy of client to use which one – Binary search or linear search. Let’s implement the problem by strategy pattern using c#.

        "title": "Check out Best SQL Server Disaster Recovery Options",
        "excerpt":"As the name suggests, Disaster Recovery means recovering in case of any disaster. This is a much popular method used for SQL Server database safeguard. By setting up a disaster recovery strategy and its timely execution, users can recover the data lost because of any type of natural or man-made disaster.   In this post, we will discuss some SQL Server Disaster Recovery options. This will help the users in choosing the right Disaster Recovery measures for SQL Server. But they must keep in mind that every organization’s need is different. That is why, the customized Disaster Recovery policy should reflect the requirements of the company.   Best SQL Server Disaster Recovery Options  Here, we will discuss the methods often considered for SQL Server Disaster Recovery by various organizations. We will learn about the approaches in brief and also know their pros and cons.   Backup and Restore  SQL Server offers this feature to its users, which is the most basic method of Disaster recovery. Using various native techniques like T-SQL, PowerShell, or SSMS, full backup of the complete database can be created and saved in a secure location. In case of both data loss and data corruption, users can easily restore the data from the last good backup. While using this feature, database can be compressed and encrypted, as these are supported by SQL Server.   Pros and Cons: The biggest advantage of this method is that the backup can be saved on any location including external media storage devices. There is also no network dependency involved in it. Its demerits are the requirement of manual database restoration and loss of data since last good backup.   Important: Microsoft suggests that you should run backup and restore in a test environment before implementing it on the business environment. Also, do not depend on this method solely in case of business-critical database.   Failover Clustering  This is another method used for downtime management and disaster recovery. Here, multiple clusters are created out of the group of servers. In case a node crashes or seizes to function, another cluster takes over the operation and automatically restarts the application. Here, it does not require any manual intervention. This method uses SAN and NAS for shared data storage and various network connections and thus removes the single failure point. Through quorum-based approach, node-level fault tolerance is increased. The same approach is used by failover cluster for monitoring cluster health.   Pros and Cons: The best thing about this solution is it gets enabled automatically whenever the primary server is unavailable. But it involves high cost and server location should be the same. On the other hand, Disk array failure is not possible to prohibit in this method. Also, these clusters are not available at database or database object level.   Log Shipping  This method got introduced in the Developer and Enterprise editions of SQL Server 2000. In the latest SQL 2017, this is supported by both the Standard and Enterprise editions. The term log shipping means exporting log file of the primary database to another database. In this process, minimum two or more SQL Server instances are involved. Apart from the primary server, other servers are the standby ones. This can be used at the database level only and not at the instance level. Also, automated failover is not available here.   Pros and Cons: With the help of this process, all database objects can be recovered during any disaster. This method also speeds up the processes of log file restoration and data recovery. During the data restoration, the database remains inaccessible. Log shipping is also devoid of granular restoration. Restoration has to be implemented for all the changes done in primary server. Besides, whenever the primary server fails, users need to redirect the applications to the standby server as automated failover is unavailable.   Database Mirroring  This solution is commonly used for SQL Server Disaster Recovery as well as High Availability . This technique can be implemented of databases with full recovery model. Users can choose from synchronous or asynchronous copy for a single database only. Since no future SQL Server versions (SQL Server 2017 is the last one) will have this feature, Microsoft asked users to go for AlwaysOn Availability Groups or Basic Availability Groups.   Pros and Cons: If you use database mirroring, you are not only become able to protect your database in a better way but also its availability gets higher. Even while upgrading, production database availability gets improved due to database mirroring. The disadvantage of this process is that the mirror database and the main database should be completely identical in every way, including all the objects and logins. Users also need to be careful about the data security as this process involves data transfer between two systems through a network.   Transactional Replication  In Transactional Replication, data from the primary Server (the publisher) is copied to the secondary Server (the subscriber). This approach can be applied to table level and other object levels. It works best when the database is small and the recovery process requires to be fast. In this way, users can use the subscriber Server if the publisher Server fails after disaster. It is mostly used in server to server environment.   Pros and Cons: In this process, the changes are done in small intervals and users can view the data during the changes are being applied. Transaction replication is slower than the process of log shipping. Replication configurations will be gone once the servers are switched. Once Replication is done, changes in Schema or security will be unavailable to the subscriber. Server switching should be done manually after the occurrence of the disaster.   SQL Recovery As The Ultimate Disaster Recovery Option  If you have lost data due to any disaster even before implementing these options, MDF Recovery tool is there for you. This software can easily recover deleted data from SQL Server database. The tool can also remove high-level corruption issues with Advanced Scan mode. This application cannot be used as the preventive measure against the disasters, but it is helpful after the data got deleted or corrupt or inaccessible.   Conclusion  As every SQL Server should have a customized Disaster Recovery policy in place, we have discussed some of the useful SQL Server Disaster Recovery options here. We presented both the pros and cons of these solutions so that users can choose the ones suitable for their requirement. It is expected that users will get benefited by this write-up.

        "title": "Learn About Microsoft SQL Server Disaster Recovery Best Practices",
        "excerpt":"Disaster Recovery is one of the burning issues in today’s tech world. While data has become the most important component of business, the rate of data loss, data deletion, and data corruption is increasing. You never know when a disaster might occur and attack our database. Therefore, you have to prepare ourselves to deal with any disaster. Precautions about disaster in equally important for SQL Server user. SQL Database is often vulnerable to different natural and man-created disasters. To safeguard the data, it is necessary to have complete knowledge about Microsoft SQL Server disaster recovery best practices. In this post, we will share with you some of Disaster Recovery practices that are considered as the best.   Best Practices Of SQL Server Disaster Recovery   The most effective practices of SQL Disaster Recovery involve looking into the database architecture and create solutions for every possible situation. The solutions can involve backup and other measures of data protection. Let us learn about all the best Disaster Recovery practices.      Design a Solution that Properly Addresses the Problem   While creating a solution for any problem, you have to make sure that it does not end up creating more problems. Though no design can be called perfect, you must focus on developing the best design that is capable of solving the problem and provide enhanced opportunity. While doing this, always note down why you picked up this particular design over others and how can this meet your goal of solving the problem. At times, when improvement in the solution is expected, design must be compatible with the current SQL Server version. Also, consider the impacts of changes on all the dependent materials, if you are planning to make any changes.      Find out Possible Weakness of the Solution   No solution design is completely flawless and that is why it is crucial to accept the limitations. This acknowledgment will help you to prepare for the disaster in a better way. There is no shame in having solutions with limited capabilities because of restricted resources and changing circumstances. But the main issue lies in accepting it and find about about automated solutions that can fulfill the limitations of the design. The same policy should be followed in other cases like active-active replication, availability group, etc.           Consider All other Possible Situations  Usually, the solution design and its limitations are evaluated based on our knowledge. But what if something else happens that you are not even considering at this point? Your knowledge (or the lack of it) can be your weak point. To counter these issues, you can consider hiring a consultant/ expert to check the design and find out its limitations.            Create the Solution  After you find out about all the possible flaws of your design, you need to create the solution as soon as possible. The solution can be anything: backup restoration or Server addition. But, it should be created without wasting any time as you do not know when the disaster might happen. The more you wait, the more risk you put your data into.            Drill, Drill, and Drill  The most important thing after setting up the Disaster Recovery Solution is to practice/ drill it. Without drilling, the complete Disaster Recovery project remains incomplete. For drilling, you can re-create the situation in a test environment and then run the solution. Do not forget to have a backup of the solution. Saving the solution script in the test environment without backup can put you in danger if the Server fails.            Train Junior DBAs  Drilling for Disaster Recovery is the best time to train the database admins who are new in this profession. Through simulation, they can be prepared for the worst situations that may occur to cover by themselves. Through practices, junior DBAs become comfortable with the “state of panic” and learn how to handle the situation.            Coordination between All the teams  In case of large-sized environments, the entire disaster recovery procedure should be done by coordinating with multiple teams like DB Admin team, System team and Developer team. In organizations that do not have this type of team division, coordination must involve everyone who might become affected by the disaster.            Appreciation and Incentive  Do not forget to appreciate yourself and everyone else involved in creating the solution and drilling it. Acknowledgment of all the good work done will function as the incentive for future.            SQL Recovery Tool As The Last Resort For Data Recovery  These are some of the best practices that can be done to protect SQL Server database during any disaster. However, these cannot assure the foolproof safety of your database items. If you have lost data from your database due to any disaster, you can take the help of SQL Recovery Tool. This application can retrieve all the deleted data from your database regardless of the cause of data loss. This application is suitable for all the latest versions of SQL Server including SQL 2017.       Conclusion  In this post, we have depicted Microsoft SQL Server Disaster Recovery best practices. Reading this, users will become aware of the practices that should be performed to ensure maximum protection against the disasters. If you still lose some data, use SQL Recovery to get back lost data of your database.   Author: Andrew Jackson  ","categories": ["SQL Server","Database"],

An entity is “Open for extension” means that its behavior can be extended to accommodate new demand. The entity is “closed for modification” means that the existing source code of the module is not changed or minimum change when making enhancement. It is clear that if a system cannot accommodate change easily, its life cycle will end fast.   Sometimes code changes introduce heavy risk. At the time of changing, you must ensure that changes will not break the system. Sometimes it takes huge regression testing. This risk can be minimized if no changes are made to existing code.   So, our intention should be writing code in such a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes or not changes in the existing code.  It should be done in a way to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes, keeping as much as possible existing code unchanged. The major advantages of “open close principle” is that it undergo changes and its value will be tremendous. It required almost no regression testing.   Let’s introduce open close principle with an example. Suppose, in our application, we need a “Area calculator” which calculate area of rectangle. However, in this occasion we just create a class AreaCalculator then there will be a method RectangleArea in this class which just calculates area of rectangle. It works fine. In the middle of the application development, we need to calculate area of Triangle and Circle. In this occasion, what should we do? We just add another two method TriangleArea and CircleArea and can do the job. But several problems will arise here – for each new shape you have to add new unit of code. Developer must have to know the logic to calculate area of new shape. Adding a new shape might effect in existing functionalities. So, it will take huge cost of regression testing. This is actually violate, open close principle.   We implement the same problem abide by open close principle by the following way. Here Rectangle, Triangle and Circle class inherit the Shape class and implement CalculateArea Method. In this way, if you need to calculate area of x shape just add a class of x and then implement shape and calculate area of x without modifying exiting code.   Class diagram:      Open Close Principle Implementation by C#:   Step 1: Create abstract Shape class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace OCP {     public abstract class Shape     {         public abstract double CalculateArea();     } }  Step 2: Create Rectangle class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace OCP {     public class Rectangle : Shape     {         public double Height { get; set; }         public double Width { get; set; }                  public Rectangle(double height, double width)         {             this.Height = height;             this.Width = width;         }                  public override double CalculateArea()         {             return Height * Width;         }     } }   Step 3: Create Triangle class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace OCP {     public class Triangle : Shape     {         public double Base { get; set; }         public double Height { get; set; }                  public Triangle(double vbase, double vheight)         {             this.Base = vbase;             this.Height = vheight;         }                  public override double CalculateArea()         {             return 1 / 2.0 * Base * Height;         }     } }   Step 4: Create circle class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace OCP {     public class Circle : Shape     {         public double Radius { get; set; }                  public Circle(double radius)         {             this.Radius = radius;         }                  public override double CalculateArea()         {             return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;         }     } }    Step 5: Client class which uses Rectangle, Triangle and Circle class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace OCP {     public class Program     {         public static void Main(string[] args)         {             Shape objShape = new Rectangle(20, 30);             Console.WriteLine(\"Area of Rectangle: \" + objShape.CalculateArea());                          objShape = new Triangle(20, 30);             Console.WriteLine(\"Area of Triangle: \" + objShape.CalculateArea());                          objShape = new Circle(4);             Console.WriteLine(\"Area of Circle: \" + objShape.CalculateArea());                          Console.ReadKey();         }     } }    Source code  ","categories": ["OOP","C#","Design Pattern"],

        "title": "Iterator design pattern with C#",
        "excerpt":"Iterator pattern is a design pattern which is used to traverse aggregate object often called container and access container’s object without exposing it’s underlying representation. Iterator pattern decoupled algorithm from aggregate object or container. In some cases, algorithms are container specific. We often use collection in C# and then we traverse the collection without knowing it’s internal details. Collection is grouping of some object. Objects can be same type or different type. Collection in fact actively used iterator pattern.      The above figure is UML class diagram for Iterator Pattern. The main idea behind the iterator pattern is to take the responsibility of traversing container and put it to the iterator object. The iterator object will maintain the state of the iteration, keeping track of the current item and track for the next item to iterate.   Benefits:      Access element of container without exposing it’s internal details.   Provides a uniform interface for traversing different collection (aggregate object).   Provides multiple simultaneous traversals in a collection.   Implementation:   Let’s come to the point. We are going to implement iterator design pattern. I am using here a collection for fruits item. The main actor in here:      IIterator – Interface to define Iterator (Concrete iterator class)   Iterator – Concrete iterator class which is used to iterate elements.   ICollection – Interface to define aggregate.   Collection – Concrete aggregate class.   I used FruitItem class as item class here.   Step 1: Create Item class.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace IteratorPattern {   /// Item class   public class FruitItem   {     public string Id { get; set; }     public string Name { get; set; }   }   }   Step 2: Create IIterator Interface   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace IteratorPattern {   /// Interface for Iterator   public interface IIterator   {     FruitItem First();     FruitItem Next();     FruitItem CurrentItem { get; }     bool IsDone { get; }   } }   Step 3: Create concrete Iterator class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace IteratorPattern {      /// Concrete Iterator Class     public class Iterator : IIterator     {                  private Collection collection;         private int current = 0;         private int step = 1;                  public Iterator(Collection vCollection)         {             this.collection = vCollection;         }                  public FruitItem First()         {             current = 0;             return (FruitItem)collection[current];         }                  public FruitItem Next()         {             current ++;                          if (!IsDone)               return (FruitItem)collection[current];             else               return null;         }                  public bool IsDone         {             get { return current &gt;= collection.Count; }         }                  public FruitItem CurrentItem         {             get { return (FruitItem) collection[current]; }         }                  // Gets or sets stepsize         public int Step         {             get { return step; }             set { step = value; }         }     } }    Step 4: Create collection interface.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace IteratorPattern {   /// Interface for Aggregate class     public interface ICollection   {     Iterator CreateIterator();   } }   Step 5: Create concrete collection class.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Collections;   namespace IteratorPattern {     ///     /// Concrete aggregate class     ///          public class Collection : ICollection     {         private ArrayList lstFoodItem = new ArrayList();                  public Iterator CreateIterator()         {             return new Iterator(this);         }                  // Get counted items         public int Count         {             get             {                 return lstFoodItem.Count;             }         }                  // Indexer         public object this[int index]         {             get { return lstFoodItem[index]; }                     set { lstFoodItem.Add(value); }         }     } }    Step 6: Create client class   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace IteratorPattern { class Program {     public static void Main(string[] args)     {         Collection collection = new Collection();                  collection[0] = new FruitItem() { Id = \"1\", Name = \"Mango\" };         collection[1] = new FruitItem() { Id = \"2\", Name = \"Orange\" };         collection[2] = new FruitItem() { Id = \"3\", Name = \"Banana\" };         collection[3] = new FruitItem() { Id = \"4\", Name = \"Apple\" };         collection[4] = new FruitItem() { Id = \"5\", Name = \"Lichi\" };         collection[5] = new FruitItem() { Id = \"7\", Name = \"Tamarind\" };                  // Create iterator         Iterator iterator = new Iterator(collection);         Console.WriteLine(\"Items by iterating over collection\");                  for (FruitItem item = iterator.First(); !iterator.IsDone; item = iterator.Next())         {             Console.WriteLine(item.Name);         }                  Console.ReadLine();     }     } }   Output:      Source code  ","categories": ["OOP","C#","Design Pattern"],

        "title": "Crystal Report With ASP.Net Step By Step",
        "excerpt":"For business or other managerial purpose, it is very important to prepare reports. We use SAP crystal reports in asp.net often for reporting purpose. Before going to the details, I hope you already know how to prepare a crystal report (something.rpt file). Here I used SAP crystal report; data is retrieved by a stored procedure which required two parameters. I used SAP Crystal Report 13.0.5 with visual studio 2012. A stored procedure is responsible to provide data to crystal report. So, let’s implement crystal report in asp.net.   Step 1: Create a report file   Create a report file (rpt_get_employee_info_dept_id_team_id.rpt). Write a stored procedure (rsp_get_employee_info_by_dept_id_team_id) to retrieve data. Set the stored procedure as crystal report data source. Design crystal reports.   Step 2: Add Assemblies   Add the following references to your web site. Version of the assembly is most important. I used assembly version: 13.0.2000.0   CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine; CrystalDecisions.Shared; CrystalDecisions.Web  Step 3: Create a report base class   This is a custom class, responsible to generate crystal report document. Some global variable is used in this class for configuration purpose. Server name, database name, user id, password is hard coded here for easily understand but I recommend, it should come from web configuration file.

        "title": "Decorator Design Pattern using C#",
        "excerpt":"You who work on design pattern must familiar with Gang of Four (GoF). Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is a Software Engineering book. The authors of this book are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides. The authors of this book are often refers to as Gang of Four (GoF). It’s a parody relating to Mao’s Gang of Four. This book describes the recurring solution of common problem in software design. The Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Factory Pattern, Abstract Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Builder e.t.c are creational design pattern. Decorator, Adapter, Bridge, Façade, Proxy, Composite e.t.c are structural design pattern. Command, interpreter, strategy, iterator e.t.c are behavioral design pattern.   Decorator Design Pattern  Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern. It is also known as wrapper. It is used to add additional functionality to a particular object during run time without affecting other objects. Responsibility can be adding or removing at run time. Critics says that it uses lot of little object of similar type.   Let’s consider a scenario in which I am going to implement Decorated Design Pattern. We, Bangladeshi are very much cricket loving. A cricket equipment shop declared some package on the occasion of Cricket World Cup 2011. The base package is with a bat and a ball and its cost is 1500 Taka (Bangladeshi Currency). The smart package is with a bat, a ball and 6 stamps i.e base package plus 6 stamps and its cost is 1500 + 600 = 2100 Taka. The special package is with a bat, a ball, 6 stamps and a pair of gloves i.e smart package plus a pair of gloves. It’s cost is 2100 + 500 = 2600 Taka. It looks like the following figure. Actually, the top one wrapped the inner packages.      Before going to implement the scenario by decorated design pattern, I would like to show you the class diagram. The class diagram is given below.      Implementation: Let’s implement decorated design pattern by C#.   Step 1: Create interface ICricketInstrument for all package of cricket instrument.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace DecoratorPattern { /// /// Interface for Cricket Instrument /// Developed by: Mahedee ///   public interface ICricketInstrument   {     double Cost { get; }     string Insturments { get; }   } }   Step 2: Create a base type for Concrete Cricket Instrument Package and Instrument Package Option   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace DecoratorPattern { /// /// Base type for concrete cricket instrument package and decorator(option). /// Developed by: Mahedee ///          public abstract class CricketInstrument : ICricketInstrument     {         private double cost = 00;         private string instrument = \"Cricket Instruments: \";                    public virtual double Cost         {           get { return cost; }         }                  public virtual string Insturments         {           get { return instrument; }         }          } }  Step 3: Create a base type for Concrete Cricket Instrument Package Option. It is actually decorator – to decorate Instrument package.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;     namespace DecoratorPattern {     /// &lt;summary&gt;     /// Decorator for concrete package option     /// &lt;/summary&gt;     public abstract class PackageOption : CricketInstrument     {         double cost = 00;         string instruments = \"Abstract Package Option\";           public override double Cost         {             get { return cost; }         }             public override string Insturments         {             get { return instruments; }         }       } }    Step 4: Create base package of Cricket Instrument.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace DecoratorPattern {     ///     /// Base Cricket Insturment Package     ///          public class BasePackage : CricketInstrument     {         double cost = 1500;         string instruments = \"Ball and Bat\";                  public override double Cost         {             get { return cost; }         }                  public override string Insturments         {             get { return base.Insturments + instruments; }         }          } }  Step 5: Decorate Smart package for Cricket Instrument   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace DecoratorPattern {     ///     /// Smart Package = Base Package (Bat, Ball) + 6 Stamps     /// Developed by: Mahedee     ///          public class SmartPackage : PackageOption     {         double cost = 600;         string instruments = \"6 Stamps\";         CricketInstrument objCricketInstrument;                  public SmartPackage(CricketInstrument objPCricketInstrument)         {             objCricketInstrument = objPCricketInstrument;         }                  public override double Cost         {             get { return objCricketInstrument.Cost + cost; }         }                  public override string Insturments         {             get { return objCricketInstrument.Insturments + \", \" + instruments; }         }     } }    Step 6: Decorate Special Package for Cricket Instrument.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace DecoratorPattern {     ///     /// Special Package = Base Package (Bat, Ball) + 6 Stamps + 1 Pair - Gloves     /// Developed by: Mahedee     ///          public class SpecialPackage : PackageOption     {         double cost = 500;         string instruments = \"Gloves - 1 Pair\";         CricketInstrument objCricketInstrument;                  public SpecialPackage(CricketInstrument objPCricketInstrument)         {             objCricketInstrument = objPCricketInstrument;         }                  public override double Cost         {             get { return objCricketInstrument.Cost + cost; }         }                  public override string Insturments         {             get { return objCricketInstrument.Insturments + \", \" + instruments; }         }          } }   Step 7: Program class to create base package and decorate other package with option.   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text;   namespace DecoratorPattern {     public class Program     {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         //Base Insturment class                  CricketInstrument objCricketInstruments = new BasePackage();         Console.WriteLine(\"::Base Package::\");         Console.WriteLine(objCricketInstruments.Insturments);         Console.WriteLine(\"Instrument's Cost: \" + objCricketInstruments.Cost);                  Console.WriteLine();                  //Smart Package         objCricketInstruments = new SmartPackage(objCricketInstruments);         Console.WriteLine(\"::Smart Package::\");         Console.WriteLine(objCricketInstruments.Insturments);         Console.WriteLine(\"Instrument's Cost: \" + objCricketInstruments.Cost);                  Console.WriteLine();                  //Special Package         objCricketInstruments = new SpecialPackage(objCricketInstruments);         Console.WriteLine(\"::Special Package::\");         Console.WriteLine(objCricketInstruments.Insturments);         Console.WriteLine(\"Instrument's Cost: \" + objCricketInstruments.Cost);                  Console.ReadLine();                  }     } }   Source Code  ","categories": ["C#","Design Pattern"],

(use \"git pull\" to update your local branch)  nothing to commit, working tree clean  If you see, any changes in upstream, you can pull upstream to your local drive   Now open a branch name feature-joining using following command   git checkout -b feature-joining  Now you will see the   Mahedee@MahedeePC MINGW64 /d/Projects/Github/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool (feature-joining)   instead of   Mahedee@MahedeePC MINGW64 /d/Projects/Github/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool (master)   Step 5: Work on the new branch and push  Now work on the new branch. After completing your task, just add, commit and push. Before that, you should check is there any change in the upstream. If change occur, just merge it with your local using the following command.   git pull --rebase upstream master  If you get any conflit, you have to resolve it locally. If no conflit occur, type the following command one by one.   git add .   git commit -m \"complete feature-joining\"   git push origin feature-joining  Step 6: Make a pull request  After completing the previous step, you will see something like the following image with a button “Compare and pull request”      Now press the button and make a pull request. Now reviewer can accept or reject the pull request (PR).  You can think the whole workflow as below      Step 7: Add your change to your forked repository Now, if you want to add your change to your forked repository. Just type the following command. Remember, in this case, your forked repository and original repository may not sync if the PR is not accepted.   git checkout master  git merge feature-joining  git push origin master  Step 8: Sync forked repository with original repository  If you want to sync your forked repository with original repository at any time. Tyep the following command.   git pull upstream master  git push origin master   Step 9: Delete the branch After accepting or rejecting your PR. You should remove the branch. For new work, you should create a new branch. To remove the local branch type the following command  git branch -d feature-joining  If you want to remove this branch from github then type the following command.  git push origin :feature-joining   Thank you for your patience :)  ","categories": ["Source Control","Github"],

Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies has been used for this application     Visual Studio 2019   Visual C#   ASP.NET Core MVC   Entity Framework   Razor view engine   Step1: Select ASP.NET Core Web Application  Select File-&gt;New-&gt;Project-&gt;ASP.NET Core Web Application   Step2: Choose project and solution name  Type project name as “HRM” and also solution name as “HRM”   Step 3: Select project template     Select project template as Web Application (Model-View-Controller)   Change authentication to Individual User Authentication (Optional)   Click create button   Step 4: Modify appsettings.json  Change connection string as follows. Since, I am using localdb.     \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=(localdb)\\\\mssqllocaldb;Database=HRMDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true\" }   Step 5: Add following model class in Models folder  Dept.cs       public class Dept     {         [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         [Key, Column(Order = 0)]         public int Id { get; set; }          [Display(Name = \"Dept. Name\")]         [StringLength(150)]         public string Name { get; set; }          public List&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }     }   Employee.cs      public class Employee     {         [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         [Key, Column(Order = 0)]         public int Id { get; set; }          [Display(Name = \"Full Name\")]         [StringLength(200)]         public string FullName { get; set; }          [Display(Name = \"Father's Name\")]         [StringLength(200)]         public string FathersName { get; set; }          [Display(Name = \"Mother's Name\")]         [StringLength(200)]         public String MothersName { get; set; }          [Display(Name = \"Dept\")]         public int DeptId { get; set; }          [StringLength(250)]         public string Designation { get; set; }          [ForeignKey(\"DeptId\")]         public virtual Dept Dept { get; set; }     }   Step 6: Create Controller and Views for Dept     Add DeptsController in Controllers folder   Choose template MVC controller with views, using Entity Framework   Select Model Class as Dept   Select ApplicationDbContext as DbContext class   DeptsController and corresponding views will be created automatically as follows   DeptsController       public class DeptsController : Controller     {         private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;          public DeptsController(ApplicationDbContext context)         {             _context = context;         }          // GET: Depts         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Index()         {             return View(await _context.Dept.ToListAsync());         }          // GET: Depts/Details/5         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Details(int? id)         {             if (id == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              var dept = await _context.Dept                 .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m =&gt; m.Id == id);             if (dept == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              return View(dept);         }          // GET: Depts/Create         public IActionResult Create()         {             return View();         }          // POST: Depts/Create         // To protect from overposting attacks, enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for          // more details, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.

        "excerpt":"  Application overview  ML.NET is a free, open source and cross platform machine learning framework. It is easily integrated with .NET development environment. ML.NET allows you to train, build, and ship custom machine learning models using C# and some other languages. Here a simple sentiment analysis application will be created using ML.NET and C#. Let’s start.   Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies has been used for this application     Visual Studio 2019   Visual C#   Step 1: Create a console application     Create a new project using visual studio 2019   Choose the C# Console App (.NET Core) project template   Change the project and solution name as “SentimentAnalysis”   Click create button to create the project.   Step 2: Enable the ML.NET Model Builder preview feature Press right button on the project file -&gt; Add -&gt; Machine learning You will see the following pop up message. Enable it.   Would you like to enable the ML.NET Model Builder preview feature so you can add Machine Learning to your .NET projects? Enable   Step 3: Select model builder scenario     Press right button on the project -&gt; Add -&gt; Machine Learning   Select Text classification   Keep the Local Environment and click on data (to move data step)     Step 4: Download and add data     Download the Sentiment Labelled Sentences datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository   Unzip the file and keep the “yelp_labelled.txt” file to Data folder   The first column of this file represents the comments and the second column represent the sentiment of the text (0 for negative and 1 for positive)   Add data     In this form, select File as the input data source type   Browse file yelp_labelled.txt. Once you are selected, you will see the preview of the data.   Select “col1” for Column to predict (Label) as the image below   Now click Train button to move to the train step      Step 5: Train your model     Time to train set automatically based on data. But you can manually set it.   Click start training button. You will see the following point the screen.   Best accuracy - Percentage of accuracy of the current model   Best model - This shows you which algorithm performed the best during Model Builder’s exploration.  Training time - Total times taken to run training Models explored (total) - This shows you the total number of models explored by Model Builder in the given amount of time.   Source : Microsoft docs      Now click Evaluate to move to the evaluate step   Step 6: Evaluate your model     Type a sentence in Try your model section.   I Typed “This is a fantastic place” and it shows positive is 98% and negative 2%      Step 7: Add project in to the solution     Click Add Project Button   Model builder will add machine learning model and the project for training   ModelBuilder.cs in the console application is used to build/train the model   Program.cs in the console application is used to test run the model   ModelInput.cs and ModelOutput.cs in Model library is the input and output class for the model training.   ConsumeModel.cs in Model library contains the method for model consumption   Solution structure will be like as follows      Step 8: Consume your model     Set SentimentAnalysisML.ConsoleApp as startup project   Modify a bit of Program.cs in SentimentAnalysisML.ConsoleApp as follows       class Program     {         static void Main(string[] args)         {             // Create single instance of sample data from first line of dataset for model input             ModelInput sampleData = new ModelInput()             {                 Col0 = @\"The food of Hotel Sonargaon was awesome\",             };              // Make a single prediction on the sample data and print results             var predictionResult = ConsumeModel.Predict(sampleData);              Console.WriteLine(\"Using model to make single prediction -- Comparing actual Col1 with predicted Col1 from sample data...\\n\\n\");             Console.WriteLine($\"Col0: {sampleData.Col0}\");             Console.WriteLine($\"\\n\\nPredicted Col1 value {predictionResult.Prediction} \\nPredicted Col1 scores: [{String.Join(\",\", predictionResult.Score)}]\\n\");              string sentiment = predictionResult.Prediction == \"1\" ? \"Positive\" : \"Negative\";             Console.WriteLine($\"Sentiment: {sentiment} \\n\");              Console.WriteLine(\"=============== End of process, hit any key to finish ===============\");             Console.ReadKey();         }     }    Step 9: Build and run the application Now build and run the application.

        "title": "Authentication and authorization using asp.net core web api and JWT (Part 01)",
        "excerpt":"  Application overview  Token based authentication has been the most popular authentication technique for the last couple of years. Before that we used session based authentication. In session based authentication, client saves session id in the cookie. In token-based authentication, token is given to client instead of session. This token contains encrypted information of user with expiry time. In this article, I will show you, how to create authentication application using asp.net core web api and JWT(Json Web Token).   Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies has been used for this application     Visual Studio 2019   Visual C#   ASP.NET Core Web API   Postman - for api testing   Let’s have a look to the implementation of the project.

        "title": "Building a web application using React and asp.net core(Part 01)",
        "excerpt":"  React is an open-source, javascript library for building UI components. It is the most popular front end framework. It is maintained by facebook. It can be used for SPA or mobile application development. On the other hand, .net core is an open-source, cross-platform supported framework. Now a days, it is also most popular for software development. In this article, I will show you, how to create a simple application with CRUD operation using asp.net core web api and react. I will show a simple employee profile of HRM application. Let’s start.   Tools and Technology used     Visual Studio Code   ASP.NET Core Web Api   Visual C#   React   Step 1: Create a new application     Visual Studio Code -&gt; File -&gt; Open Folder   Go to View -&gt; Terminal   Type dotnet new react -o HRM in the terminal   Type cd HRM to enter into the HRM folder   In the application folder you will see another folder name ClientApp which is actually react application inside dotnet application.   Now run the application using donet run command   Step 2: Create model classes     Create a model class name Employee in Model folder as follows   Employee.cs      public class Employee     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public string Designation {get; set;}         public string FathersName{get; set;}         public string MothersName{get; set;}         public DateTime DateOfBirth{get; set;}     }   Step 3: Install in memory database provider for entity framework core     Go to the terminal and type the following command  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory   Step 4: Create a dbContext class     Create HRMContext Class in Db folder as follows   HRMContext.cs   using HRM.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace HRM.Db {     public class HRMContext : DbContext     {         public HRMContext(DbContextOptions&lt;HRMContext&gt; options) : base(options)         {          }         public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }     } }      Configure in memory database in the ConfigureService method of Startup class as follows.   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {     services.AddDbContext&lt;HRMContext&gt;(opt =&gt; opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"HRMDB\")); }   Step 5: Add some seed data     Create a class name SeedDataGenerator in Db folder as follows   using System; using System.Linq; using HRM.Db; using HRM.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;  public class SeedDataGenerator {     public static void Initialize(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)     {         using (var context = new HRMContext(             serviceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;DbContextOptions&lt;HRMContext&gt;&gt;()))         {             // Check any employee exists              if (context.Employees.Any())             {                 return; // Data already exists no need to generate             }              context.Employees.AddRange(                 new Employee                 {                     Name = \"Md. Mahedee Hasan\",                     Designation = \"Head of Software Development\",                     FathersName = \"Yeasin Bhuiyan\",                     MothersName = \"Moriom Begum\",                     DateOfBirth = new DateTime(1984, 12, 19, 00, 00, 00)                 },                  new Employee                 {                     Name = \"Khaleda Islam\",                     Designation = \"Software Engineer\",                     FathersName = \"Shahidul Islam\",                     MothersName = \"Momtaz Begum\",                     DateOfBirth = new DateTime(1990, 10, 29, 00, 00, 00)                 },                                  new Employee                 {                     Name = \"Tahiya Hasan Arisha\",                     Designation = \"Jr. Software Engineer\",                     FathersName = \"Md. Mahedee Hasan\",                     MothersName = \"Khaleda Islam\",                     DateOfBirth = new DateTime(2017, 09, 17, 00, 00, 00)                 }             );             context.SaveChanges();          }     } }      Call SeedDataGenerator from Program class to generate seed data as follows   using HRM.Db; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;  namespace HRM {     public class Program     {         public static void Main(string[] args)         {             //CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();              // 1. Get the IHost which will host this application             var host = CreateHostBuilder(args).Build();              // 2. Find the service within the scope to use             using (var scope = host.Services.CreateScope())             {                 // 3. Get the instance of HRMContext in our service layer                 var services = scope.ServiceProvider;                 var context = services.GetRequiredService&lt;HRMContext&gt;();                  // 4. Call the SeedDataGenerator to generate seed data                 SeedDataGenerator.Initialize(services);               }              // Run the application              host.Run();         }          public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;             Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)                 .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;                 {                     webBuilder.UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();                 });     } }    Step 6: Create IRepository and Repository class in the Repository folder as follows   IEmployeeRepository.cs    using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using HRM.Models;  namespace HRM.Repository {     public interface IEmployeeRepository     {         public Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt;&gt; SelectAllEmployees();         public Task&lt;Employee&gt; SelectEmployee(int id);         public Task&lt;string&gt; UpdateEmployee(int id, Employee employee);         public Task&lt;string&gt; SaveEmployee(Employee employee);         public Task&lt;string&gt; DeleteEmployee(int id);     } }     EmployeeRepository.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks; using HRM.Db; using HRM.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace HRM.Repository {     public class EmployeeRepository : IEmployeeRepository     {         private readonly HRMContext _context;          public EmployeeRepository(HRMContext context)         {             _context = context;         }          public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt;&gt; SelectAllEmployees()         {             try             {                 var allemployess = _context.Employees.ToListAsync();                 return await allemployess;             }             catch (Exception exp)             {                 throw (exp);             }         }          public async Task&lt;Employee&gt; SelectEmployee(int id)         {             try             {                 var employee = _context.Employees.FindAsync(id);                 return await employee;             }             catch (Exception exp)             {                 throw (exp);             }         }          public async Task&lt;string&gt; UpdateEmployee(int id, Employee employee)         {             if (id != employee.Id)             {                 return \"Cannot be updated!\";             }              _context.Entry(employee).State = EntityState.Modified;              try             {                 await _context.SaveChangesAsync();                 return \"Data updated successfully!\";             }             catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException exp)             {                 if (!EmployeeExists(id))                 {                     return \"Data not found!\";                 }                 else                 {                     throw (exp);                 }             }         }          public async Task&lt;string&gt; SaveEmployee(Employee employee)         {             _context.Employees.Add(employee);             try             {                 await _context.SaveChangesAsync();                 return \"Data saved successfully!\";             }             catch (Exception exp)             {                 throw (exp);             }         }          public async Task&lt;string&gt; DeleteEmployee(int id)         {             var employee = await _context.Employees.FindAsync(id);             if (employee == null)             {                 return \"Data not found!\";             }              _context.Employees.Remove(employee);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              return \"Data deleted successfully!\";         }          private bool EmployeeExists(int id)         {             return _context.Employees.Any(e =&gt; e.Id == id);         }      } }    Step 7: Create IEmployeeService and EmployeeService class in the Services folder as follows   IEmployeeService.cs  using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using HRM.Models;  namespace HRM.Services {     public interface IEmployeeService     {         public Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt;&gt; GetEmployees();         public Task&lt;Employee&gt; GetEmployee(int id);         public Task&lt;string&gt; EditEmployee(int id, Employee employee);         public Task&lt;string&gt; AddEmployee(Employee employee);         public Task&lt;string&gt; RemoveEmployee(int id);      } }    EmployeeService.cs   using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using HRM.Models; using HRM.Repository;  namespace HRM.Services {     public class EmployeeService : IEmployeeService     {         IEmployeeRepository _employeeRepository;         public EmployeeService(IEmployeeRepository repository)         {             _employeeRepository = repository;         }          public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt;&gt; GetEmployees()         {             try             {                 return await _employeeRepository.SelectAllEmployees();             }             catch(Exception exp)             {                 throw (exp);             }         }          public async Task&lt;Employee&gt; GetEmployee(int id)         {             try             {                 return await _employeeRepository.SelectEmployee(id);             }             catch(Exception exp)             {                 throw(exp);             }         }          public async Task&lt;string&gt; EditEmployee(int id, Employee employee)         {             try             {                 return await _employeeRepository.UpdateEmployee(id, employee);             }             catch(Exception exp)             {                 throw(exp);             }         }          public async Task&lt;string&gt; AddEmployee(Employee employee)         {             try             {                 return await _employeeRepository.SaveEmployee(employee);             }             catch(Exception exp)             {                 throw(exp);             }         }          public async Task&lt;string&gt; RemoveEmployee(int id)         {             try             {                 return await _employeeRepository.DeleteEmployee(id);             }             catch(Exception exp)             {                 throw(exp);             }         }      } }   Step 7: Register interfaces and corresponding concrete class in the ConfigureServic method   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {     services.AddDbContext&lt;HRMContext&gt;(opt =&gt; opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"HRMDB\"));           services.AddControllersWithViews();      // In production, the React files will be served from this directory     services.AddSpaStaticFiles(configuration =&gt;

I run the following script in Ordering.API project and got the following error.   PM&gt; Add-Migration initial Build started... Build succeeded. Your target project 'Ordering.API' doesn't match your migrations assembly 'Ordering.Infrastructure'. Either change your target project or change your migrations assembly. Change your migrations assembly by using DbContextOptionsBuilder. E.g. options.UseSqlServer(connection, b =&gt; b.MigrationsAssembly(\"Ordering.API\")). By default, the migrations assembly is the assembly containing the DbContext. Change your target project to the migrations project by using the Package Manager Console's Default project drop-down list, or by executing \"dotnet ef\" from the directory containing the migrations project.   Solution  Step 1: Install the following nuget packages in Ordering.Infrastructure where DbContext class is present.   Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools   Step 2: Run the migration command in Ordering.Infrastructure project.

        "excerpt":"  Application overview  ML.NET is a free, open source and cross platform machine learning framework. It is easily integrated with .NET development environment. ML.NET allows you to train, build, and ship custom machine learning models using C# and some other languages. Here a simple sentiment analysis application will be created using ML.NET and C#. Let’s start.   Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies has been used for this application     Visual Studio 2019   Visual C#   Step 1: Create a console application     Create a new project using visual studio 2019   Choose the C# Console App (.NET Core) project template   Change the project and solution name as “SentimentAnalysis”   Click create button to create the project.   Step 2: Enable the ML.NET Model Builder preview feature Press right button on the project file -&gt; Add -&gt; Machine learning You will see the following pop up message. Enable it.   Would you like to enable the ML.NET Model Builder preview feature so you can add Machine Learning to your .NET projects? Enable   Step 3: Select model builder scenario     Press right button on the project -&gt; Add -&gt; Machine Learning   Select Text classification   Keep the Local Environment and click on data (to move data step)     Step 4: Download and add data     Download the Sentiment Labelled Sentences datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository   Unzip the file and keep the “yelp_labelled.txt” file to Data folder   The first column of this file represents the comments and the second column represent the sentiment of the text (0 for negative and 1 for positive)   Add data     In this form, select File as the input data source type   Browse file yelp_labelled.txt. Once you are selected, you will see the preview of the data.   Select “col1” for Column to predict (Label) as the image below   Now click Train button to move to the train step      Step 5: Train your model     Time to train set automatically based on data. But you can manually set it.   Click start training button. You will see the following point the screen.   Best accuracy - Percentage of accuracy of the current model   Best model - This shows you which algorithm performed the best during Model Builder’s exploration.  Training time - Total times taken to run training Models explored (total) - This shows you the total number of models explored by Model Builder in the given amount of time.   Source : Microsoft docs      Now click Evaluate to move to the evaluate step   Step 6: Evaluate your model     Type a sentence in Try your model section.   I Typed “This is a fantastic place” and it shows positive is 98% and negative 2%      Step 7: Add project in to the solution     Click Add Project Button   Model builder will add machine learning model and the project for training   ModelBuilder.cs in the console application is used to build/train the model   Program.cs in the console application is used to test run the model   ModelInput.cs and ModelOutput.cs in Model library is the input and output class for the model training.   ConsumeModel.cs in Model library contains the method for model consumption   Solution structure will be like as follows      Step 8: Consume your model     Set SentimentAnalysisML.ConsoleApp as startup project   Modify a bit of Program.cs in SentimentAnalysisML.ConsoleApp as follows       class Program     {         static void Main(string[] args)         {             // Create single instance of sample data from first line of dataset for model input             ModelInput sampleData = new ModelInput()             {                 Col0 = @\"The food of Hotel Sonargaon was awesome\",             };              // Make a single prediction on the sample data and print results             var predictionResult = ConsumeModel.Predict(sampleData);              Console.WriteLine(\"Using model to make single prediction -- Comparing actual Col1 with predicted Col1 from sample data...\\n\\n\");             Console.WriteLine($\"Col0: {sampleData.Col0}\");             Console.WriteLine($\"\\n\\nPredicted Col1 value {predictionResult.Prediction} \\nPredicted Col1 scores: [{String.Join(\",\", predictionResult.Score)}]\\n\");              string sentiment = predictionResult.Prediction == \"1\" ? \"Positive\" : \"Negative\";             Console.WriteLine($\"Sentiment: {sentiment} \\n\");              Console.WriteLine(\"=============== End of process, hit any key to finish ===============\");             Console.ReadKey();         }     }    Step 9: Build and run the application Now build and run the application.

        "excerpt":"Distributed transaction is one that spans multiple databases across the network while preserving ACID properties. It is very important in Microservices because of its distributed nature. To manage data consistency we may use SAGA design pattern. In this article, I will show you distributed transaction using SAGA pattern, RabbitMQ and asp.net core.   Saga Pattern   A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the local database and publishes a messages or event to message broker for updating next corresponding database. If next database transaction fails, a series of transactions will occur to undo the changes.   Saga is implemented in two ways -     Choreography   Orchestration   Choreography In choreography, participants exchange events without a centralized control.      Fig - Choreography saga (Collected)   Orchestration In orchestration, participants exchange events with a centralized control.

        "excerpt":"  Application overview  In ASP.NET core, we often use application settings from different configuration files and load to a some files. Application settings can be in the appsettings.json or docker-compose.yml or .env or any other configuration file. We can use IOptions to read these settings using C#. Here is a sample code to retrieve application setting from appsettings.json, docker-compose.yml and .env file.   Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies has been used for this application     Visual Studio 2019   Visual C#   ASP.NET Core Web API   .NET Framework 5.0   Step 1: Create a asp.net core web api project     Create a new project using visual studio 2019   Choose the C# ASP.NET Web API (.NET Core) project template   Create a web api project name - “Catalog.API”   Step 2: Add docker and docker compose file     Click right button on project -&gt; Add Docker Support -&gt; Linux   Click right button on project -&gt; Container Orchestrator Support -&gt; Linux   Step 3: Modify appsettings.json     Modify appsettings.json as follows   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\",       \"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime\": \"Information\"     }   },    \"ConnectionString\": \"Server=(localdb)\\\\mssqllocaldb;Database=CatalogDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true\",   \"ServiceName\" :  \"Catalog.API\",   //\"Server\": \"LocalSQLServer\",   \"Port\": 112233,    \"DatabaseSettings\": {     \"Server\": \"localhost\",     \"Provider\": \"SQL Server\",     \"Database\": \"DemoDb\",     \"Port\": 1234,     \"UserName\": \"sa\",     \"Password\": \"mahedee123\"   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\" }    Step 4: Add .env file in the root directory     Add .env file int root directory and modify as follows   # PORT = 4444  CONFIG_STORAGE_CATALOG_URL=http://host.docker.internal:5202/c/api/v1/catalog/items/[0]/pic/ NAME = Md.

        "title": "Playing with Clean Architecture and CQRS pattern using asp.net core, EF and Dapper",
        "excerpt":"  Introduction   Clean architecute was created by Robert C. Martin known as Uncle Bob. It’s now mostly used software architecute especially in microservice architecture. In this article, I will discuss about clean architecute a bit and then implement the concept using clean architecture and CQRS pattern using asp.net core, entity framework core and dapper. The main concept of clean architecture is that the core logic of the application is changed rarely so it will be independent and considered it as core.      Fig - The Clean Architecture (Picture collected from internet)   In clean architecture, based on the picture, the domain and application layers remain in the center of the design which is known as core of the application. The domain layer contains enterprise logic and the application layer contains business logic. Generally, business logic is not sharable, it is for that particualr business only but enterprise logic can be shared across many related system.   Advantages      Highly maintainable - It’s follows seperation of concern.   UI Independent - It is loosely coupled with UI layer. So, you can change UI without changing the core buisness.   Highly Testable - Apps built using this approach, and especially the core domain model and its business rules, are extremely testable.   Framework Independent - You can use any langulage like C#, Java, Python to implement clean architecture.   Scalable - Can implement CQRS pattern. So, it is highly scalable.   CQRS Pattern   CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation. Main concern of this pattern is seperation of concern. It seperates read and command (insert, update, delete) operations. It is mostly used for performance and scalability.   Now, I will show you a sample project in which I have implemented Clean Architecture with CQRS pattern.   Tools and technologies used     Clean Architecture   CQRS Pattern   Visual Studio 2019   .NET 5.0   SQLite   Dapper   Entity Framework   AutoMapper   MediatR   ASP.NET Core Web API   C#   Implementation   Step 1: Create solution and projects.

        "excerpt":"Sometimes we need to work in a disconnected environment. In that situation, we need to export/import docker images and container. Here I will show how to export and import images and container.   Save and load docker images  Step 1: Create a sample asp.net core application - name CatalogApp   Step 2: Containerize CatalogApp     Add a dockerfile in the root directory - here dockerfile and sln file exists in the same directory.   You see how to Containerize a .NET Core app   # https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build WORKDIR /source  # copy csproj and restore as distinct layers COPY *.sln . COPY CatalogApp/*.csproj ./CatalogApp/ RUN dotnet restore  # copy everything else and build app COPY CatalogApp/. ./CatalogApp/ WORKDIR /source/CatalogApp RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore  # final stage/image FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 WORKDIR /app COPY --from=build /app ./ ENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"CatalogApp.dll\"]   Step 3: Run in linux container     Navigate to the Dockerfile folder   Run the following commands to build the application in docker     docker build -t catalogapp .           Now you will see an image name catalogapp is created. To check images, run the following command.     docker images           If you want to run the application (images) in docker, run the following command     docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 --name catalogapp_container catalogapp           Browse application at http://localhost:5000/ to see output   Step 3: Save docker images     To export “catalogapp” image run the following command     docker save -o D:\\Images\\catalogapp.tar catalogapp           You will see a catalogapp.tar file in D:\\Images\\ directory   Step 4: Now load docker images     You may run the following command to remove all docker images     docker rmi $(docker images -q)           Go to to the directory D:\\Images\\   Run the following command to load images. You will see two images is created with dev and latest tag.     PS D:\\Images&gt; docker load -i catalogapp.tar           Run loaded image     Now run the following command to run the catalogapp images with latest tag.     docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 --name catalogapp_container catalogapp:latest           Browse application at http://localhost:5000/ to see output   Export and import docker container  Step 1: Create a sample asp.net core application as before - name CatalogApp   Step 2: Containerize CatalogApp     Add a dockerfile in the root directory - here dockerfile and sln file exists in the same directory.   You see how to Containerize a .NET Core app   # https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build WORKDIR /source  # copy csproj and restore as distinct layers COPY *.sln .

Now you will see an image name catalogapp is created. To check images, run the following command.     docker images           If you want to run the application (images) in docker, run the following command     docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 --name catalogapp_container catalogapp           Browse application at http://localhost:5000/ to see output   Step 3: Export docker container     To export “catalogapp_container” container run the following command     docker export -o D:\\Containers\\catalogapp_container.tar catalogapp_container           You will see a catalogapp_container file in D:\\Containers\\ directory   Step 4: Now import docker container     You may run the following command to remove all docker images     docker rmi $(docker images -q)           Go to to the directory D:\\Containers\\   Run the following command to load images. You will see two images is created with dev and latest tag.     PS D:\\Containers&gt; docker import catalogapp_container.tar catalogapp:imp           Run Imported image     Now run the following command to run the catalogapp images with latest tag.     docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 --name catalogapp_container catalogapp:imp           Browse application at http://localhost:5000/ to see output   Summary  Let’s summarize the idea of image and container export and import.     Image load is just copying and container import is just like turn container to image.   To export and import images, use docker save and load command.   To export and import container, use docker export and import command.   Exported tar file is smaller than saved tar file. Because the exported file is a container, when the export file is imported, all the history of the image (that is, the information of each layer) cannot be retained, and the rollback operation cannot be performed. And save is based on the mirror image, so you can completely retain the information of each layer when importing.   It’s not possible to rename loaded images but you can do it for imported image like catalogapp:imp   Source Code    ","categories": ["Docker","ASP.NET Core","Microservices"],

        "excerpt":"  Overview  Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. Google orignially designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) now maintains the project. In this article, I will show you how to configure kubernetese single node cluster on local environment and deploy an asp.net core application using docker hub.   Tools and Technology used   The following tools and technologies has been used for this application      Visual Studio 2022   Visual C#   ASP.NET Core Web API   Docker Desktop   Step 1: Install &amp; Setup Hyper-V      Go to Control Panel   On your left panel, click on Programs   Then click Programs and Features followed by Turn Windows features on and off.   Check Hyper-V and Windows Hypervisor Platform   Click OK         Run the following command as Administrator on powershell and verify if Hyper-V is installed successfully on your machine:   Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V   Note: The above command didn’t work after installed WSL2 on Docker desktop. You may skip this step if you want to install latest version of Docker with WSL 2.   Step 2: Install Docker Desktop for Windows      Download and install docker desktop on windows   Step 3: Install Kubectl     Install and Set Up kubectl on Windows   If you have installed Docker Desktop before, you have installed kubectl and Docker Desktop for windows added it to the PATH.   Check installed kubectl version using the following command   kubectl version --short   Step 4: Install Kubernetes on Windows      Right-click on the Docker tray icon   Click “Settings”   On the left panel click “Kubernetes”   Check Enable Kubernetes and click “Apply &amp; Restart”         Notes: Some commands you can check -   docker info  kubectl cluster-info  docker container ls  kubectl get nodes\t//shows list of nodes   Step 5: Login on docker hub      Got docker hub and create and account it’s free.   Login to your account from docker desktop.   Step 6: Create an ASP.NET core Web API Project           Open Visual Studio and Create an Web API Project. Ex. Catalog.API            Install the following packages in the project.       Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design      Add Connection String on appsettings.json as follows   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\"     }   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\",   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=192.168.7.154;Database=Demo.CustomerDB;User Id=sa;Password=yourPassword;\"   } }       Create a model class name - Product Model in Models folder   Product.cs   using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;  namespace Catalog.API.Models {     public class Product     {         [Key]         [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }          public string Description { get; set; }          public decimal Price { get; set; }          public int AvailableStock { get; set; }          public int RestockThreshold { get; set; }     } }       Add CatalogDbContext class in Db folder as follows   CatalogDbContext.cs    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace Catalog.API.Db {     public class CatalogDbContext : DbContext     {         public CatalogDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;CatalogDbContext&gt; options) : base(options)         {          }         public DbSet&lt;Catalog.API.Models.Product&gt; Product { get; set; }     } }       Create a Contoller class name ProductsController as follows   ProductsController.cs   #nullable disable using Catalog.API.Db; using Catalog.API.Models; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace Catalog.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase     {         private readonly CatalogDbContext _context;          public ProductsController(CatalogDbContext context)         {             _context = context;         }          // GET: api/Products         [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt;&gt; GetProduct()         {             return await _context.Product.ToListAsync();         }          // GET: api/Products/5         [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; GetProduct(int id)         {             var product = await _context.Product.FindAsync(id);              if (product == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              return product;         }          // PUT: api/Products/5         // To protect from overposting attacks, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2123754         [HttpPut(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PutProduct(int id, Product product)         {             if (id != product.Id)             {                 return BadRequest();             }              _context.Entry(product).State = EntityState.Modified;              try             {                 await _context.SaveChangesAsync();             }             catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)             {                 if (!ProductExists(id))                 {                     return NotFound();                 }                 else                 {                     throw;                 }             }              return NoContent();         }          // POST: api/Products         // To protect from overposting attacks, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2123754         [HttpPost]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; PostProduct(Product product)         {             _context.Product.Add(product);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              return CreatedAtAction(\"GetProduct\", new { id = product.Id }, product);         }          // DELETE: api/Products/5         [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteProduct(int id)         {             var product = await _context.Product.FindAsync(id);             if (product == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              _context.Product.Remove(product);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              return NoContent();         }          private bool ProductExists(int id)         {             return _context.Product.Any(e =&gt; e.Id == id);         }     } }       Run the following command to add migration and update database   PM&gt; Add-Migration init-mig PM&gt; Update-Database -Verbose      Add a docker file in the root directory with the following code.   Dockerfile   #See https://aka.ms/containerfastmode to understand how Visual Studio uses this Dockerfile to build your images for faster debugging.  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base WORKDIR /app EXPOSE 80 EXPOSE 443  EXPOSE 8011 ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://*:8011    ENV ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build WORKDIR /src COPY [\"/Catalog.API.csproj\", \"Catalog.API/\"] RUN dotnet restore \"Catalog.API/Catalog.API.csproj\"  WORKDIR \"/src/Catalog.API\" COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"Catalog.API.dll\"]    Step 7: Push image to docker hub      Go to the project root directory where docker file exists.   Login to docker desktop.   Use the following command to check login status.   docker login      Use the following command to build container image.    docker image build -t mahedee/catalog:1.0.4 .  Format: docker image build -t {username}/{imagename}:{tag} .   Note: There is a dot at the end of the command.      Use the following command to check already created image   docker images      Push image to docker hub using following command.     docker image push mahedee/catalog:1.0.4          Format: docker image push {username}/{imagename}:{tag}       Now login to hub.docker.com and you will see new image inside repository (https://hub.docker.com/repositories)   Step 8: Configure Pod for Kubernetes      Create a pod manifest file name pod.yml in deploy/k8s folder with below code.   apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: catalog-pod   labels:     app: web-api  spec:   containers:     - name: web-ctr       image: mahedee/catalog:1.0.4       ports:         - containerPort: 8011       Go to the the directory where pod.yml file resides and run the below command.   kubectl apply -f pod.yml   Output:  pod/catalog-pod created      State of the created pods can be checked by the below command.   kubectl get pods --watch      If you need to delete a pod write below command    kubectl delete pod catalog-pod  or   kubectl delete -f pod.yml   Step 9: Expose kubernetes service      Create a service pod using the following command   kubectl expose pod catalog-pod --name=catalog-svc --type=NodePort --port=8011   Output   service/catalog-svc exposed      Check created services using following command   kubectl get svc      To see the details of the service, use the following command   kubectl describe svc catalog-svc   Output:   Name:                     catalog-svc Namespace:                default Labels:                   app=web-api Annotations:              &lt;none&gt; Selector:                 app=web-api Type:                     NodePort IP Family Policy:         SingleStack IP Families:              IPv4 IP:                       10.101.161.222 IPs:                      10.101.161.222 LoadBalancer Ingress:     localhost Port:                     &lt;unset&gt;  8011/TCP TargetPort:               8011/TCP NodePort:                 &lt;unset&gt;  32461/TCP Endpoints:                10.1.0.10:8011 Session Affinity:         None External Traffic Policy:  Cluster Events:                   &lt;none&gt;      From the above output, you can see the node port is exposed on 32461 port.   Now browse the application using the following URL: http://localhost:32461/swagger/index.html   Step 10: Configure Kubernetes dashboard      Dashboard UI is not configured by default. To configure, run the following command.   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.3.1/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml      You can check the namespaces with the below command.   kubectl get ns   Output:   NAME                   STATUS   AGE default                Active   4d5h kube-node-lease        Active   4d5h kube-public            Active   4d5h kube-system            Active   4d5h kubernetes-dashboard   Active   123m   If you see the above output, we can see a new namespace name - kubernetes-dashboard.      You can check if any pods are running on newly created namespace with the below command.   kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get pods -o wide      Check service type with the following command.   kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get svc   Default service type is ClusterIP and it cannot be access from outside the cluster. We don’t need to modify Service file because we are not going to expose the cluster to the outside world.      Create a file name - dashboard-adminuser.yaml and add the following code in dashboard-adminuser.yaml   dashboard-adminuser.yaml   apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata:   name: kubernetes-dashboard --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata:   name: admin-user   namespace: kubernetes-dashboard --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata:   name: admin-user roleRef:   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io   kind: ClusterRole   name: cluster-admin subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount   name: admin-user   namespace: kubernetes-dashboard      As we are using new cluster binding so we need to delete the existing Cluster Binding section from kubernetes-dashboard file, otherwise an error will return. Use below command to delete.   kubectl delete clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard      Go to the directory where dashboard-adminuser.yaml is resides and execute the following command.   kubectl apply -f dashboard-adminuser.yaml      Now we need to find token we can use to log in. Execute following command:   kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get sa/admin-user -o jsonpath=\"{.secrets[0].name}\") -o go-template=\"\"      Copy the genereted token and open another terminal type the following command.   kubectl proxy           Now, use below URL to access the dashboard. http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/            Select token of the UI and pest copied token and click sign in. You will see the dashboard screen.       Some Kubectl commands   kubectl version --short // Check Kubectl version  docker info  kubectl cluster-info  docker container ls  kubectl get nodes\t//shows list of nodes  kubectl apply -f pod.yml  kubectl get pods --watch  kubectl get pods -o wide  kubectl describe pods my-pod // to see the details about pod  kubectl delete -f pod.yml // delete already created pod by pod.yml  kubectl delete pod mypod // delete particular pod  kubectl delete svc mysvc // delete particular service  kubectl expose pod my-pod --name=my-svc --type=NodePort // create a service pod  kubectl get svc // check created services  // deploy kubernetes dashboard using the following command kubectl apply -f .\\recommended.yaml.txt  // Verify the running pod kubectl.exe get -f .\\recommended.yaml.txt  // Generate token for the dashboard  ((kubectl -n kube-system describe secret default | Select-String \"token:\") -split \" +\")[1]  kubectl proxy.    Some Docker commands   docker login  docker image build -t mahedee/demoapp:1.0.0 .  docker image push mahedee/demoapp:1.0.0 .  docker images  docker images ls    Source Code    ","categories": ["ASP.NET","ASP.NET Core","C#","Kubernetes"],

        "excerpt":"  Overview  Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. Google orignially designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) now maintains the project. In this article, I will show you how to configure kubernetese multi-node cluster using containerd and deploy an asp.net core application using docker hub.   Prerequisite   In this article, I am going to describe the procedure of installation and configuration of Kubernetes on Virtual Machine. Here, I have used VMWare workstation and created 3 VM using the following requirements.   System Requirements     Linux (Ubuntu 21.04)   CPU 2/4 Core   Ram 3/6 GB   Hardisk 15 GB   Container Runtime - Containerd   Make sure swap is disabled on the system.   Note: Kubernetes version 1.20, Docker was the container runtime used. In version 1.20, Docker was deprecated and will be removed in 1.23, or later.   Assumption for Network     We need network connectivity between all nodes in the cluster.   Ensure each system has unique Hostname.   Unique Mac Address for each system.   Required Packages     Containerd - Uses for container runtime   Kubelet - Drive the work on individual nodes in a cluster.   Kubeadm - Kubeadm is a tool which is responsible for bootstraping a cluster and getting the cluster component up, running and configured. This tool also use to join additional nodes to a cluster.   Kubectl - This is the primary command line tool touse to administrate the workloads in a cluster.   I will install all of the above packages in all nodes.   Step 1: Environment setup      Install Ubuntu on 3 VMs to build kubernetes cluster with one control plane node/Master ndoe and two worker nodes.   I have used ubuntu-21.04-desktop-amd64.iso to configure Master and worker nodes.              Resources for Master Node              Linux (Ubuntu 21.04)       CPU 2 Core       Memory 3 GB       Disk Space 15 GB                Resources for Worker Node 1 and 2              Linux (Ubuntu 21.04)       CPU 2 Core       Memory 3 GB       Disk Space 15 GB           Here, I am going to configure each of virtual machine with below hostname and static IP. You can use your static IP based on your network setup. Main thing is that each VM has to access internet and has to connect one another through LAN.                      Machine Name       Host Name       IP Address                       Master       mh-master       192.168.233.10                 Node 1       mh-n1       192.168.233.11                 Node 2       mh-n2       192.168.233.12           Step 2: Configure Master Node           Assume that you have already installed Ubuntu on the VM with the above configuration for Master node.       Configure Static IP on Master Node            Go to to right corner of desktop -&gt; Wired Connection -&gt;Wired Settings -&gt; Setting of Wired Tab -&gt; Ipv4 -&gt; Set the IP, Gateway and DNS as below.             Restart and Login in to the Master VM   Open Terminal and write the below command to update the host name.   sudo nano /etc/hostname  A text editor will open. Update the name to mh-master, save and exit.         Write below command to get the name of ethernet interface   ip link  Output   1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 2: ens33: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000     link/ether 00:0c:29:fa:a6:42 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     altname enp2s1   From the above output, we can see that the ethernet interface name is ens33.      Write the below command on terminal to assign static IP address on the network interface.   sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml      Update the yml file with the below code.   # Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system network:   version: 2   renderer: NetworkManager   ethernets:     ens33:       dhcp4: false       addresses: [192.168.233.10/16]       gateway4: 192.168.233.2       nameservers:         addresses: [192.168.233.2,8.8.8.8]     Save and exit.   Apply the changes by running the following command on the terminal.   sudo netplan apply      Now we are going to update hosts file, as we have decided earlier about the host name and IP addresses of each Node. Write below command to open the hosts editor.   sudo nano /etc/hosts      Update the page with below text. Hosts file includes name to IP mapping for VMs.   192.168.233.10  mh-master 192.168.233.11  mh-n1 192.168.233.12  mh-n2        Save and exit.   Reboot the system.   Step 3: Installation of OpenSSH-Server      Run the following command to install openssh-server.   sudo apt-get install openssh-server    Step 4: Turn off Swap Space      Write below command on terminal to swapoff.   sudo swapoff -a      Open fstab file and delete or comment swap line as below, I have commented the swapfile line. Write below command to open fstab file.   sudo nano /etc/fstab        Save and exit.   Reboot the system.   Step 5: Install and configure Containerd   We need to load the two modules and configure them to load on boot before start installing Containerd.      Write the below commands to load modules.   sudo modprobe overlay sudo modprobe br_netfilter      Write below command to make sure loaded modules are set on boot.   cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/containerd.conf overlay br_netfilter EOF      Now we need to Setup required sysctl parameters which persist across reboots. Write below command.   cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-kubernetes-cri.conf net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1 net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1 EOF      Apply sysctl parameters without reboot with below command.   sudo sysctl --system      Now is the time to install containerd. Write below commands to install containerd.   sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y containerd   It will take some time to install containerd.      Create a directory for containerd configuration file using following command.   sudo mkdir -p /etc/containerd      Set the cgroup driver for containerd to systemd which is required for the kubelet. Write the following command to open the config.toml file.   sudo nano /etc/containerd/config.toml      Write the following command to generate default configuration file and write the generated output to config.toml file.   sudo containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml      Now we are going to set the cgroup driver for containerd to systemd which is required for the kubelet. Write below command to open the config.toml file.   sudo nano /etc/containerd/config.toml      In the config.toml file, update SystemdCgroup. change it from SystemdCgroup = false to SystemdCgroup = true   Note: Ctrl + w for search.         Save and Exit.   Restart containerd with the new configuration. Write below command.   sudo systemctl restart containerd   Step 6: Install and Configure Kubeadm, Kubelet and Kubectl      Install curl using following command   sudo apt install curl   Or   sudo apt-get install -y curl   Note: If you see any process locking message. Restart the VM.      First we need to add Google’s apt repository gpg key to our system so that we can trust the repository. Write below command   curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add --   Output:   Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)). OK      Add the Kubernetes apt repository and that going to configure that local apt repository to our local system. Write below command.   sudo bash -c 'cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main EOF'      Update the package list and use apt-cache policy to inspect versions available in the repository. Write below command.   sudo apt-get update apt-cache policy kubelet | head -n 20      Now we are going to Install the required packages, if needed we can request a specific version.   VERSION=1.21.0-00 sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=$VERSION kubeadm=$VERSION kubectl=$VERSION      Write below command to mark all four packages hold and this will prevent these packages from being updated.   sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl containerd      Check the status of kubelet with below command. The kubelet will enter a crashloop until a cluster is created or the node is joined to an existing cluster.   sudo systemctl status kubelet.service      Check the status of Containerd with below command.   sudo systemctl status containerd.service   If you see the containerd is active and running, it means it is up and loaded and in a proper state.      Ensure Kubelet and Containerd are set to start when the system starts up. Write below command to execute.   sudo systemctl enable kubelet.service sudo systemctl enable containerd.service   Step 7:Install and configure control plane / Master node   Creating a Cluster      Write the below command to download calico.yaml file.   wget https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml      Open calico.yaml and find the setting for Pod Network IP address range CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR, adjust if needed for your infrastructure to ensure that the Pod network IP, range doesn’t overlap with other networks in our infrastructure.   sudo nano calico.yaml      As you can see the value for CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR is 192.168.0.0/16. All pods are going to be allocated IP’s from that network range. We need to make sure that the network range should not overlap with other network in our infracture. Exit without update anything in this page.      Generate a default kubeadm init configuration file. This defines the settings of the cluster being built. Write below command to create kubeconfig init configuration file. This configuration file is going to define the settings of the cluster that kubeadm going to built for us.   kubeadm config print init-defaults | tee ClusterConfiguration.yaml     advertiseAddress is the IP address of the API Server and we are going to update that to our IP address of our Control Plane Node which is our cluster going to be 192.168.254.10. we are also going to update criSocket from dockershim to container runtime we are using which is containerd.      Change the address of the localAPIEndpoint.advertiseAddress to the Control Plane Node’s IP address. Write below command.   sed -i 's/  advertiseAddress: 1.2.3.4/  advertiseAddress: 192.168.233.10/' ClusterConfiguration.yaml      Set the CRI Socket to point to containerd with below command.   sed -i 's/  criSocket: \\/var\\/run\\/dockershim\\.sock/  criSocket: \\/run\\/containerd\\/containerd\\.sock/' ClusterConfiguration.yaml      Added configuration to set the node name for the control plane node to the actual hostname.   sed -i 's/  name: node/  name: mh-master/' ClusterConfiguration.yaml      Set the cgroupDriver to system for the kubelet. This configuration is not exist default that generated by kubeadm so we are going to add that to our cluster configuration file. Write below command.   cat &lt;&lt;EOF | cat &gt;&gt;  ClusterConfiguration.yaml --- apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: KubeletConfiguration cgroupDriver: systemd EOF      Review the Cluster configuration file, update the version to match what you’ve installed. Write below command.   cat ClusterConfiguration.yaml         Now we are going to bootstrap our cluster and going to add CRI socket since there’s a check for docker in the kubeadm init process.   sudo kubeadm init \\     --config=ClusterConfiguration.yaml \\     --cri-socket /run/containerd/containerd.sock      Configure our account on the Control Plane Node to have admin access to the API server from a non-privileged account. Create a directory by below command.   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube      Now copy that admin.conf file into our users home directory so we can use that to connect to kubernetes.   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config      We are now going to change the permissions on that so regular user can access the file.   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config   Step 8: Creating a Pod Network      Deploy yaml file for pod network References with below command.   kubectl apply -f calico.yaml      Look for the all the system pods and calico pods to change to Running. The DNS pod won’t start (pending) until the Pod network is deployed and Running.   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces   Output:   NAMESPACE     NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE kube-system   calico-kube-controllers-6fd7b9848d-vhjxp   1/1     Running   0          113s kube-system   calico-node-zbtrv                          1/1     Running   0          113s kube-system   coredns-558bd4d5db-njgwh                   1/1     Running   0          9m23s kube-system   coredns-558bd4d5db-w2rx7                   1/1     Running   0          9m23s kube-system   etcd-mh-master                             1/1     Running   0          9m30s kube-system   kube-apiserver-mh-master                   1/1     Running   0          9m30s kube-system   kube-controller-manager-mh-master          1/1     Running   0          9m30s kube-system   kube-proxy-bbrh9                           1/1     Running   0          9m23s kube-system   kube-scheduler-mh-master                   1/1     Running   0          9m30s    All pods are running.           Control plane pods:              etcd-mh-master       kube-apiserver-mh-master       kube-controller-manager-mh-master       kube-scheduler-mh-master           Kube proxy Pod:            kube-proxy-bbrh9 (This pod is going to implement service networking on individual nodes)           Core DNS Pods:            coredns-558bd4d5db-njgwh       coredns-558bd4d5db-w2rx7           Calico Pods:            calico-kube-controllers-6fd7b9848d-vhjxp       calico-node-zbtrv           You can also check with below command for continuous iteration status of each pods.   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --watch      Get a list of our current nodes with below command   kubectl get nodes      Check out the systemd unit and it’s no longer crash looping because it has static pods to start.   sudo systemctl status kubelet.service   You can exit by pressing ( ctrl+c );   Step 9: Static Pod manifests      Check static pod manifests on the Control Plane Node with below command.   ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests   Output:   etcd.yaml  kube-apiserver.yaml  kube-controller-manager.yaml  kube-scheduler.yaml      You can also look more closely at API server and etcd’s manifest with below command.   sudo more /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml sudo more /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml      Check out the directory where the kubeconfig files live for each of the control plane pods.   ls /etc/kubernetes   Output:   admin.conf  controller-manager.conf  kubelet.conf  manifests  pki  scheduler.conf   Configure Worker Nodes 1   Step 10: Configure Host name, Hosts file and define a static IP address           Assume that you have already installed Ubuntu on the VM with the mentioned configuration for the Node1.       Configure Static IP on Master Node            Go to to right corner of desktop -&gt; Wired Connection -&gt;Wired Settings -&gt; Setting of Wired Tab -&gt; Ipv4 -&gt; Set the IP, Gateway and DNS as below.             Login into Node1 VM and open Terminal.   Write below command to update the host name.   sudo nano /etc/hostname   A text editor will open and update the name to mh-n1 and save and exit.         Write below command to identify the name of the Ethernet interface.   ip link   Output:   1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 2: ens33: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000     link/ether 00:0c:29:32:3d:0f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     altname enp2s1   As we can see that our ethernet interface name is ens33.     To assign a static IP address on the network interface, open the YAML configuration file with a text editor with below command.   sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml      Update the page with below code.   network:   version: 2   renderer: NetworkManager   ethernets:     ens33:       dhcp4: false       addresses: [192.168.233.11/16]       gateway4: 192.168.233.2       nameservers:         addresses: [192.168.233.2,8.8.8.8]      Save and exit   Apply the changes by running the following command.   sudo netplan apply      Now we are going to update hosts file, as we have decided earlier about the host name and IP addresses of each Node. Write below command to open the hosts editor.   sudo nano /etc/hosts      Hosts file includes name to IP mappings for VMs. Update the page with below text.   192.168.233.10  mh-master 192.168.233.11  mh-n1 192.168.233.12  mh-n2          Save and exit.   Reboot the system.   Step 11: Installation of OpenSSH-Server      Now we have to install openshh-server. Run the following command:   sudo apt-get install openssh-server     Step 12: Turn off swap space      We need disable swap before we start doing any other process. Write below command to swapoff.   sudo swapoff -a      Open fstab file and delete or comment swap line as below, I have commented the swapfile line. Write below command to open fstab file.   sudo nano /etc/fstab      Save and exit.   Reboot the system.   Step 13: Installation and Configuration of Containerd   We are going to load two modules and configure them to load on boot before start installing Containerd. The process of installing containerd is same as we did for Master Node.      Write below commands to load modules.   sudo modprobe overlay sudo modprobe br_netfilter      Write below command to make sure loaded modules are set on boot.   cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/containerd.conf overlay br_netfilter EOF       Now we need to Setup, required sysctl parameters which persist across reboots. Write below command.   cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-kubernetes-cri.conf net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1 net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1 EOF       Apply sysctl parameters without reboot with below command.   sudo sysctl --system      Now is the time to install containerd. Write below commands to install containerd.   sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y containerd      We need to apply some configuration specific to containerd, first we will create a directory for a containerd configuration file to keep, then we will use containerd command to generate default configuration file and write the generated output to config.toml file with below commands.   sudo mkdir -p /etc/containerd  sudo containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml      Now we are going to set the cgroup driver for containerd to systemd which is required for the kubelet. Write below command to open the config.toml file.   sudo nano /etc/containerd/config.toml      In the config.toml file, update SystemdCgroup. change it from SystemdCgroup = false to SystemdCgroup = true              Save &amp; Exit.            Restart containerd with the new configuration. Write below command.       sudo systemctl restart containerd   Step 14: Install and Configure Kubeadm, Kubelet and Kubectl      Now we are going to Install Kubernetes packages - kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl.  First we need to add Google’s apt repository gpg key to our system so that we can trust the repository. Write below command. (please install curl if not installed)   sudo apt-get install -y curl  curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -    Output:   Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)). OK      Add the Kubernetes apt repository and that going to configure that local apt repository to our local system. Write below command.   sudo bash -c 'cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main EOF'      Update the package list and use apt-cache policy to inspect versions available in the repository. Write below command.   sudo apt-get update apt-cache policy kubelet | head -n 20   Output:   kubelet:   Installed: (none)   Candidate: 1.23.5-00   Version table:      1.23.5-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages      1.23.4-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages      1.23.3-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages      1.23.2-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages      1.23.1-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages      1.23.0-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages      1.22.8-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages      1.22.7-00 500         500 https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages  In the output, we can see different versions of kubelet that are available as packages in the repository.      Now we are going to Install the required packages, if needed we can request a specific version.   VERSION=1.21.0-00  sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=$VERSION kubeadm=$VERSION kubectl=$VERSION      Write below command to mark all four packages hold and this will prevent these packages from being updated.   sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl containerd      Check the status of kubelet with below command. The kubelet will enter a crashloop until a cluster is created or the node is joined to an existing cluster.   sudo systemctl status kubelet.service          You can exit by pressing ( ctrl+c )            Check the status of Containerd with below command.       sudo systemctl status containerd.service  We can see that Containerd is active and running, so it is up and loaded and in a proper state.      Ensure Kubelet and Containerd are set to start when the system starts up. Write below command to execute.   sudo systemctl enable kubelet.service  sudo systemctl enable containerd.service   Step 15: Configure Worker Nodes 2      Please follow the same instruction to configure Node 2, except update the IP address to 192.168.233.12 and Host name to mh-n2   Step 16: Join the Node to the Cluster   As we have already configured Master and worker nodes, now is the time to connect Nodes with cluster. We going to need both bootstrap token and also the CA Cert hash to join nodes with cluster. We can copy these information from the output of kubeadm init. Bootstrap token is a timed ticket and it has 24 hours lifecyle which means a new token need to be generate after 24 hours.      Login into Master Node and write below command to check if any token is active or not.   sudo kubeadm token list   As we can see, we did not get any result because we don’t have any created token or token has been timed out or expired. In your case, you might get a token if you check after kubeadm init process.      Now we are going to generate a new token with below command.   kubeadm token create   Output:   w8fovt.svvzo8jntyrdqzph   We can see that a new token has been created. If you check token list now, a new token will be found on the list.   kubeadm token list      We can find CA Cert Hash on the Control Plane Node with below command.   openssl x509 -pubkey -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2&gt;/dev/null | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | sed 's/^.* //'  Output:   318fba0270967d24200c9eaf21857a7d90bce44a857aa8ea397337e8afe7c18d   Now we can take all of these information and make the join command with kubeadm joins by specifying the bootstrap token and CA Cert Hash but there is another way to connect nodes with cluster. We are going to join nodes with cluster with command.      We can also use print-join-command to generate token and print the join command in the proper format. Write below command and generate the join command.   kubeadm token create --print-join-command   Output:   kubeadm join 192.168.233.10:6443 --token xgsdjp.1u45r4zhk6uhuv43 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:318fba0270967d24200c9eaf21857a7d90bce44a857aa8ea397337e8afe7c18d    We can see above well-formatted join command with the proper parameters and values including the location of the API Server, the Bootstrap token and CA Cert Hash.   Now we are going to copy the above generated command and going to use this command on Worker nodes to connect with cluster.      Login into Node1 and use previously generated command from master node. In my case, generated command is below which I am going to use in Node1 and Node2.   sudo kubeadm join 192.168.233.10:6443 –token xgsdjp.1u45r4zhk6uhuv43 –discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:318fba0270967d24200c9eaf21857a7d90bce44a857aa8ea397337e8afe7c18d   ***Note: Above command will be different in your case. Use your generated command instead of using above command.      On the above output we can see, it executes the preflight checks first and then wait for the kubelet to perform the TLS Bootstrap process. We can also see from the bottom output that the node has been joined to the cluster.  We have use the same command on Node 2, in my case mh-n2.         Login back to Control Plane or Master Node, write below command to verify all connected nodes.   kubectl get nodes   Output:   NAME        STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION mh-master   Ready    control-plane,master   31h     v1.21.0 mh-n1       Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 2m47s   v1.21.0 mh-n2       Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 92s     v1.21.0   ***Note: Above output might say Not Ready until the networking pod is created on the new node. From the above output we can see both nodes are connected on the cluster and status is ready.      On the Control Plane Node, watch for the calico pod and the kube-proxy to change to Running on the newly added nodes by below command.   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --watch   Step 17: Deploying the Dashboard UI   Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface which we can use to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot the containerized application, and manage the cluster resources. Dashboard also provides information on the state of Kubernetes resources in the cluster and on any errors that may have occurred.      The Dashboard UI is not deployed by default. To deploy it, run the following command on master node.   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.3.1/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml   Output:   namespace/kubernetes-dashboard created serviceaccount/kubernetes-dashboard created service/kubernetes-dashboard created secret/kubernetes-dashboard-certs created secret/kubernetes-dashboard-csrf created secret/kubernetes-dashboard-key-holder created configmap/kubernetes-dashboard-settings created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard created deployment.apps/kubernetes-dashboard created service/dashboard-metrics-scraper created deployment.apps/dashboard-metrics-scraper created       Let’s check the namespaces with below command.   kubectl get ns   Output:   NAME                   STATUS   AGE default                Active   47h kube-node-lease        Active   47h kube-public            Active   47h kube-system            Active   47h kubernetes-dashboard   Active   79s   On the above output, we can see a new namesapce - kubernetes-dashboard in the list.      Now is the time to check if any pods are running on newly created namespaces with below command.   kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get pods -o wide   Output:   NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP               NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES dashboard-metrics-scraper-856586f554-dvmvg   1/1     Running   0          3m59s   172.16.191.193   mh-n1   &lt;none&gt;           &lt;none&gt; kubernetes-dashboard-67484c44f6-sbgbf        1/1     Running   0          3m59s   172.16.96.129    mh-n2   &lt;none&gt;           &lt;none&gt;  We can see that two pods are running within above namespace.      Check the service type with below command.   kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get svc   Output:   NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE dashboard-metrics-scraper   ClusterIP   10.111.160.160   &lt;none&gt;        8000/TCP   5m58s kubernetes-dashboard        ClusterIP   10.101.169.107   &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP    5m59s  Default service type is ClusterIP and it cannot be access from outside the cluster. We don’t need to modify Service file because we are not going to expose the cluster to the outside world.           Create a file and name the file dashboard-adminuser.yaml with below command. cat &gt; dashboard-adminuser.yaml            Copy and paste following code on dashboard-adminuser.yaml file.       apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata:   name: kubernetes-dashboard --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata:   name: admin-user   namespace: kubernetes-dashboard --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata:   name: admin-user roleRef:   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io   kind: ClusterRole   name: cluster-admin subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount   name: admin-user   namespace: kubernetes-dashboard  ```ps  Note: Ctrl + C to exit  * You can check the pasted code on dashboard-adminuser.yaml file using following command.  ```ps sudo nano dashboard-adminuser.yaml      As we are using new cluster binding so we need to delete the existing Cluster Binding section from kubernetes-dashboard file, otherwise an error will return. Use below command to delete.   kubectl delete clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard      Now we are going to execute newly created file with below command.   kubectl apply -f dashboard-adminuser.yaml   Output:   namespace/kubernetes-dashboard unchanged serviceaccount/admin-user created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/admin-user created     Now we need to find token we can use to log in. Execute following command:   kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get sa/admin-user -o jsonpath=\"{.secrets[0].name}\") -o go-template=\"\"      From the above output we can see a new token has been generated, we can copy the above output token to login into dashboard.      Use following command to enable the access to the Dashboard using the kubectl command-line tool.   kubectl proxy   Output:   Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001      Use below URL to access the dashboard.   http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/      Use above created token and click sign in button.      Workload section will show empty because we have not deployed any containerized pod yet. You can click cluster tab on left pane and will find list of cluster roles, Namespaces, Nodes and Storage Classes. You will find two nodes in the list of Nodes.      Deploy an asp.net core application in a pod to the target node   Step 18: Assign level to the nodes   Now we are going to deploy a containerized pod to target node. Before we assign the pod we are going to set a label for node.      Check current label of nodes with below command in master node terminal.   kubectl get nodes --show-labels   Output:   NAME        STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION   LABELS mh-master   Ready    control-plane,master   2d10h   v1.21.0   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=mh-master,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=,node-role.kubernetes.io/master=,node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers= mh-n1       Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 27h     v1.21.0   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=mh-n1,kubernetes.io/os=linux mh-n2       Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 27h     v1.21.0   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=mh-n2,kubernetes.io/os=linux       Now we are going to set custom label for nodes. I have decided to set the label for mh-n1 will be env=dev and mh-n2 will be env=prod. Use below commands to set labels for nodes.   kubectl label nodes mh-n1 env=dev kubectl label nodes mh-n2 env=prod      We can recheck label name again with below command.   kubectl get nodes --show-labels   Output:   NAME        STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION   LABELS mh-master   Ready    control-plane,master   2d10h   v1.21.0   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=mh-master,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=,node-role.kubernetes.io/master=,node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers= mh-n1       Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 27h     v1.21.0   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,env=dev,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=mh-n1,kubernetes.io/os=linux mh-n2       Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 27h     v1.21.0   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,env=prod,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=mh-n2,kubernetes.io/os=linux   Step 19: Deploying Resources Declaratively   Now we are going to deploy pod declaratively with YAML file.      We are going to use dry-run=client to create a yaml manifest file for deployment with a container image. We could write the yaml by hand, but we can use dry-run=client to build it for us. Write below command to generate yaml manifest file.   kubectl create deployment hrm \\      --image=docker.io/mahedee/hrm:1.0.1 \\      --dry-run=client -o yaml | more   Output:   apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   creationTimestamp: null   labels:     app: hrm   name: hrm spec:   replicas: 1   selector:     matchLabels:       app: hrm   strategy: {}   template:     metadata:       creationTimestamp: null       labels:         app: hrm     spec:       containers:       - image: docker.io/mahedee/hrm:1.0.1         name: hrm         resources: {} status: {}        Let’s write this deployment yaml out to file. We are now redirecting previously generated output to deployment.yaml file.   kubectl create deployment hrm \\      --image=docker.io/mahedee/hrm:1.0.1 \\      --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; deployment.yaml      Edit deployment.yaml file to set a node label. Use below command to edit the file.   sudo nano deployment.yaml      Update the file with below text.   piVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   creationTimestamp: null   labels:     app: hrm   name: hrm spec:   replicas: 1   selector:     matchLabels:       app: hrm   strategy: {}   template:     metadata:       creationTimestamp: null       labels:         app: hrm     spec:       containers:       - image: docker.io/mahedee/hrm:1.0.1         name: hrm         ports:         - containerPort: 8011         resources: {} status: {}      Use below command to execute the deployment.yaml manifest file.   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml  Output:   deployment.apps/hrm created      Now generate the yaml for the service with below command.   kubectl expose deployment hrm \\      --port=80 --target-port=8011 \\      --dry-run=client -o yaml | more      Write the service yaml manifest to a file. Target port is 8011. Because image internal port is 8011   kubectl expose deployment hrm        –port=80 –target-port=8011        –dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; service.yaml      Modify the service using the following command.   sudo nano service.yaml   piVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   creationTimestamp: null   labels:     app: hrm   name: hrm spec:   type: NodePort   ports:   - port: 80     protocol: TCP     targetPort: 8011   selector:     app: hrm status:   loadBalancer: {}           Save and Exit            Use below command to execute the service yaml file declaratively.       kubectl apply -f service.yaml   Output:   service/hrm created      Check out our current state, Deployment, ReplicaSet, Pod and a Service.   kubectl get pod -o wide  Output:   NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES hrm-697468d799-t48rb   1/1     Running   0          25m   172.16.96.133   mh-n2   &lt;none&gt;           &lt;none&gt;   In the above, we see pod is running on mh-n2 means node 2   kubectl get all -o wide   Output:    NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES pod/hrm-697468d799-t48rb   1/1     Running   0          27m   172.16.96.133   mh-n2   &lt;none&gt;           &lt;none&gt;  NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE    SELECTOR service/hrm          NodePort    10.103.252.75   &lt;none&gt;        80:32614/TCP   24m    app=hrm service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP        5d4h   &lt;none&gt;  NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE   CONTAINERS   IMAGES                        SELECTOR deployment.apps/hrm   1/1     1            1           27m   hrm          docker.io/mahedee/hrm:1.0.1   app=hrm  NAME                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE   CONTAINERS   IMAGES                        SELECTOR replicaset.apps/hrm-697468d799   1         1         1       27m   hrm          docker.io/mahedee/hrm:1.0.1   app=hrm,pod-template-hash=697468d799    We can see recent deployed pod and service from the above output and running without error. hrm pod has been deployed to mh-n2 node as per configuration of label. See first row.      Kubectl create deployment we executed, it created a deployment for us. Let’s look more closely at that deployment.   kubectl get deployment hrm   Output:   NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE hrm    1/1     1            1           13m      Deployments are made of ReplicaSets and ReplicaSets create Pods!   kubectl get replicaset kubectl get pods   Output:   mh-master@mhmaster-virtual-machine:~$ kubectl get replicaset NAME             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE hrm-697468d799   1         1         1       29m mh-master@mhmaster-virtual-machine:~$ kubectl get pods NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE hrm-697468d799-t48rb   1/1     Running   0          30m       Check running service using the following command.   kubectl get svc   Output:   NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE hrm          NodePort    10.103.252.75   &lt;none&gt;        80:32614/TCP   27m kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP        5d5h      Check service information using following command.   kubectl get svc hrm  Output:  NAME   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE hrm    NodePort   10.103.252.75   &lt;none&gt;        80:32614/TCP   33m      Acces the service inside the cluster using curl command.   curl http://10.103.252.75:80/swagger/index.html      We can also get that information from using describe.   kubectl describe service hrm   Output:   Name:                     hrm Namespace:                default Labels:                   app=hrm Annotations:              &lt;none&gt; Selector:                 app=hrm Type:                     NodePort IP Family Policy:         SingleStack IP Families:              IPv4 IP:                       10.103.252.75 IPs:                      10.103.252.75 Port:                     &lt;unset&gt;  80/TCP TargetPort:               8011/TCP NodePort:                 &lt;unset&gt;  32614/TCP Endpoints:                172.16.96.133:8011 Session Affinity:         None External Traffic Policy:  Cluster Events:                   &lt;none&gt;      Access the service using the following URL on the browser.   http://localhost:32614/swagger/index.html   Output:      Step 20: Verify with Dashboard UI      Log back to dashboard UI to verify the current state.

        "excerpt":"  In the previous article, I have shown you how to create a back end application for authentication and authorization using JWT and .net core. In this article, I will design UI using react.js. I will also show you how to maintain authentication and authorization from front end.   Step 1: Create a sample react application     Create a react app name - ecommerce.client using the following command.     npx create-react-app my-app           Apply required bootstrap theme on it.   Step 2: Create config.js in public/assets folder   config.js   var baseURL = \"https://localhost:7142/\";   Step 3: Include config.js in public/index.html file   index.html   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;   &lt;head&gt;     &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;     &lt;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" /&gt;     &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /&gt;     &lt;meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#000000\" /&gt;     &lt;meta       name=\"description\"       content=\"Web site created using create-react-app\"     /&gt;     &lt;link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png\" /&gt;     &lt;!--       manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a       user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/     --&gt;     &lt;link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json\" /&gt;     &lt;!--       Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.       It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.       Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.        Unlike \"/favicon.ico\" or \"favicon.ico\", \"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" will       work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.       Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.     --&gt;     &lt;title&gt;React::Auth&lt;/title&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body&gt;     &lt;noscript&gt;You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div id=\"root\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;!--       This HTML file is a template.       If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.        You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.       The build step will place the bundled scripts into the &lt;body&gt; tag.        To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.       To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.     --&gt;      &lt;script src=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/assets/config.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;    Step 4: Create components in src folder      Create AccessAPI and Settings Components in src-&gt;components-&gt;services folder   Settings.js   export const BASE_URL = window.baseURL;

        "title": "Application health monitoring using asp.net core",
        "excerpt":"  Introduction   Health monitoring provides real-time information about the state of the application. It’s a very crucial part for large distributed application. Especially, microservies based application. In this article, I will show you how to monitor application’s health in different ways.   Tools and technologies used     Visual Studio 2022   .NET 6.0   SQL Server   Entity Framework   ASP.NET Core Web API   C#   Implementation   Step 1: Create solution and projects.      Create a solution name HealthCheck   Add 4 new web api project, name - Admin.API, Customer.API, Location.API and WebStatus in the solution.   Here WebStatus project will monitor health of Admin.API, Customer.API and Location.API project and display result on watchdog.   Step 2: Install nuget packages.      Install following nuget package in Admin.API Project   PM&gt; Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI.Client      Install following nuget packages in Customer.API Project   PM&gt; Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI.Client PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore PM&gt; Install-Package System.Data.SqlClient       Install following nuget packages in Location.API Project   PM&gt; Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI.Client PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore PM&gt; Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer       Install following nuget packages in WebStatus Project   PM&gt; Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI PM&gt; Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI.InMemory.Storage   Step 3: Configure Admin.API project for health check      Modify Program.cs file is as follows   using HealthChecks.UI.Client; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container.  builder.Services.AddControllers();  // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();  // Register required services for health checks builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();   var app = builder.Build();  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     app.UseSwagger();     app.UseSwaggerUI(); }  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  // Cofigure for health check app.MapHealthChecks(\"/hc\", new HealthCheckOptions() {     Predicate = _ =&gt; true,     ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse, });  //a basic health probe configuration that reports the app's availability to process requests (liveness) is sufficient to discover the status of the app. app.MapHealthChecks(\"/liveness\", new HealthCheckOptions() {     Predicate = r =&gt; r.Name.Contains(\"self\"), });  app.Run();       Here, Registered healthcheck service using   builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();      Added healthcheck end point using following code     // Cofigure for health check app.MapHealthChecks(\"/hc\", new HealthCheckOptions() {     Predicate = _ =&gt; true,     ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse, });  //a basic health probe configuration that reports the app's availability to process requests (liveness) is sufficient to discover the status of the app. app.MapHealthChecks(\"/liveness\", new HealthCheckOptions() {     Predicate = r =&gt; r.Name.Contains(\"self\"), });             Now you can run and check the application health using the following URL       https://localhost:7147/hc       https://localhost:7147/liveness       Step 4: Configure Customer.API project for health check      Add ConnectionString in appsettings.json file as follows   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\"     }   },   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"CustomerDBConnection\": \"Server=localhost;Database=Demo.CustomerDB;User Id=sa;Password=secret@pass;\"   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\" }       Add CustomerDbContext class in Customer.API/Db folder CustomerDbContext.cs    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace Customer.API.Db {     public class CustomerDbContext : DbContext     {         public CustomerDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;CustomerDbContext&gt; options) : base(options)         {          }     } }        Add DatabaseHealthCheck and HealthCheckResponse class in Customer.API/Utility folder   DatabaseHealthCheck.cs    using Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks; using System.Data.SqlClient;  namespace Customer.API.Utility {     public class DatabaseHealthCheck : IHealthCheck     {         private IConfiguration _configuration;         public DatabaseHealthCheck(IConfiguration configuration)         {             _configuration = configuration;         }         public async Task&lt;HealthCheckResult&gt; CheckHealthAsync(HealthCheckContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)         {                          string _connectionString = _configuration.GetConnectionString(\"CustomerDBConnection\");              using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))             {                 try                 {                     connection.Open();                 }                 catch (SqlException)                 {                     // return HealthCheckResult.Healthy();

        "excerpt":"  Introduction   API Gateway is an API management tools that sits between a client application and backend application. It agregates different services, maintain load balancing and work as reverse proxy. Ocelot is an api managment tool which is very powerful and best fit for .net application.   Tools and technologies used     Visual Studio 2022   .NET 6.0   In Memory Database   Entity Framework   ASP.NET Core Web API   C#   Ocelot   Implementation   Step 1: Create solution and projects.      Create a solution name APIGateway   Add 4 new web api project, name - Catalog.API, Location.API, Ordering.API and BFF.Web in the solution.   Here, BFF.Web project will act as API Gateway.   Step 2: Install nuget packages.      Install following nuget package in Catalog.API Project   PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools      Install following nuget package in Ordering.API Project   PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools      Install following nuget packages in BFF.Web Project   PM&gt;

        "title": "Configure service mesh using Istio with asp.net core applications on Kubernetes",
        "excerpt":"Overview   A service mesh is a configurable infrustructure layer. It have capabilities to handle service-to-service communication, resilency, and many cross-cutting concerns. Proxy is a key component of service mesh. Sidecar proxy is injected in each services in this concept. Here I will show you service mesh communication using Istio with asp.net core applications on Kubernetes environment.   Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow accross microservices, enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data. Istio uses following tools -      Prometheus: It monitors everything in the cluster.   Grafana: Data visualization tools.   Jaeger: It’s used for distributed tracing.   Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies used to configure Istio     Visual Studio 2022   Visual C#   ASP.NET Core Web API   Ocelot   Docker desktop   Kubernetes   Istio   Let’s configure Istio on asp.net core web api applications.   Step 1: Download Istio     Go to the link below and download “istio-1.12.2-win.zip”  https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.12.2   or download and extract the latest release automatically (Linux or macOS): curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -           Extract zip file and move to the Istio Package directory. For example, istio-1.12.2.            Then installation directory contains:             Sample applications in sample/directory       The istioctl client binary in the bin/directory           Step 2: Add istioctl client to your path      Use the following command in git bash to add istioctl client to your path.   export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH   Note: The above command doesn’t run on powershell. So, use git bash. If you close the git bash, istioctl doesn’t work. You have to run the above command again.      To check istioctl client use the following command in git bash.   istioctl   Step 3: Install Istio      For installation, we use the demo configuration profile. It’s selected to have a good set of defaults for testing, but there are other profiles for production or performance testing. Use below command to install Istio.   istioctl install --set profile=demo -y     Use the following command to verify Istio.   kubectl get all -n istio-system   Output:   NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE pod/istio-egressgateway-c9cbbd99f-wk265     1/1     Running   0          87s pod/istio-ingressgateway-7c8bc47b49-xpvvc   1/1     Running   0          86s pod/istiod-765596f7ff-2p72v                 1/1     Running   0          3m13s  NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                                      AGE service/istio-egressgateway    ClusterIP      10.101.157.106   &lt;none&gt;        80/TCP,443/TCP                                                               85s service/istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.109.205.109   localhost     15021:32149/TCP,80:30563/TCP,443:30960/TCP,31400:32369/TCP,15443:32309/TCP   85s service/istiod                 ClusterIP      10.109.211.149   &lt;none&gt;        15010/TCP,15012/TCP,443/TCP,15014/TCP                                        3m12s  NAME                                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE deployment.apps/istio-egressgateway    1/1     1            1           87s deployment.apps/istio-ingressgateway   1/1     1            1           86s deployment.apps/istiod                 1/1     1            1           3m13s  NAME                                              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE replicaset.apps/istio-egressgateway-c9cbbd99f     1         1         1       87s replicaset.apps/istio-ingressgateway-7c8bc47b49   1         1         1       86s replicaset.apps/istiod-765596f7ff                 1         1         1       3m13s   Step 4: Configure for auto proxy injection      Add a namespace label to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies when you deploy your application later. Use below command to configure default namespance with Istio sidecar proxy.   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled      Check label by using below command   kubectl describe namespace default   Step 5: Create asp.net core applications      Create 4 asp.net core web api projects.   Projects names are Catalog.API, Location.API, Ordering.API and BFF.Web.   Step 6: Organize Catalog.API Project      Add the following nuget packages in the project.   Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools      Add a model class name Product in the model folder.   Product.cs   using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;  namespace Catalog.API.Model {     public class Product     {         [Key]         [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }          public string Description { get; set; }          public decimal Price { get; set; }          public int AvailableStock { get; set; }          public int RestockThreshold { get; set; }     } }       Add CatalogContext class in Db folder.   CatalogContext.cs   using Catalog.API.Model; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace Catalog.API.Db {     public class CatalogContext : DbContext     {         public CatalogContext(DbContextOptions&lt;CatalogContext&gt; options) : base(options)         {          }         protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)         {             base.OnConfiguring(optionsBuilder);         }          public DbSet&lt;Product&gt; Products { get; set; }     } }       Configure InMemory database and modify Program class as follows.   Program.cs   using Catalog.API.Db; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container.  builder.Services.AddControllers();  builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;CatalogContext&gt;(opt =&gt; opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"CatalogDB\"));  // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();  var app = builder.Build();  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     app.UseSwagger();     app.UseSwaggerUI(); }  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  app.Run();       Create ProductsController in Controllers folder   ProductsController.cs   #nullable disable using Catalog.API.Db; using Catalog.API.Model; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace Catalog.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase     {         private readonly CatalogContext _context;          public ProductsController(CatalogContext context)         {             _context = context;         }          // GET: api/Products         [HttpGet(\"GetAll\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt;&gt; GetProducts()         {             return await _context.Products.ToListAsync();         }          // GET: api/Products/5         [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; GetProduct(int id)         {             var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);              if (product == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              return product;         }          // PUT: api/Products/5         // To protect from overposting attacks, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2123754         [HttpPut(\"Edit/{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PutProduct(int id, Product product)         {             if (id != product.Id)             {                 return BadRequest();             }              _context.Entry(product).State = EntityState.Modified;              try             {                 await _context.SaveChangesAsync();             }             catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)             {                 if (!ProductExists(id))                 {                     return NotFound();                 }                 else                 {                     throw;                 }             }              return NoContent();         }          // POST: api/Products         // To protect from overposting attacks, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2123754         [HttpPost(\"Add\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; PostProduct(Product product)         {             _context.Products.Add(product);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              return CreatedAtAction(\"GetProduct\", new { id = product.Id }, product);         }          // DELETE: api/Products/5         [HttpDelete(\"Delete/{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteProduct(int id)         {             var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);             if (product == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              _context.Products.Remove(product);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              return NoContent();         }          private bool ProductExists(int id)         {             return _context.Products.Any(e =&gt; e.Id == id);         }     } }       Add Dockerfile in the Catalog.API Project   Dockerfile    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base WORKDIR /app EXPOSE 80 EXPOSE 443  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build WORKDIR /src COPY [\"/Catalog.API.csproj\", \"Catalog.API/\"] RUN dotnet restore \"Catalog.API/Catalog.API.csproj\" WORKDIR \"/src/Catalog.API\" COPY . .

Install Kiali and other addons and wait for them to be deployed. Execute below command inside Istio folder. Use Git bash instead of powershell.   kubectl apply -f samples/addons      Execute below command and wait till get success roll out message.   kubectl rollout status deployment/kiali -n istio-system   Note: If there are errors trying to install the addons, try running the command again. There may be some timing issues which will be resolved when the command is run again.      Verify the deployment with below command.   kubectl get po -n istio-system   Output:   NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE grafana-6ccd56f4b6-sc894                1/1     Running   0          13m istio-egressgateway-c9cbbd99f-wk265     1/1     Running   0          87m istio-ingressgateway-7c8bc47b49-xpvvc   1/1     Running   0          87m istiod-765596f7ff-2p72v                 1/1     Running   0          89m jaeger-5d44bc5c5d-g2wcl                 1/1     Running   0          13m kiali-79b86ff5bc-cqwrp                  1/1     Running   0          13m prometheus-64fd8ccd65-lglld             2/2     Running   0          13m      Now run the Kiali dashboard using the below command   istioctl dashboard kiali  Kiali dashboard will be open.   Hit the gateway URL. Use the following URL and hit several times and you will get the reflect in kiali dashbaord as below.   http://localhost:8011/swagger/index.html   Select Swagger definition from top right corner of BFF      Step 12: Monitoring with Prometheus &amp; Grafana      Check Prometheus and Grafana is running using the following command.   kubectl get po -n istio-system      Run Prometheus dashboard using the following command   istioctl dashboard prometheus   View graph in diffrent ways like -      Select istio_requests_total.   Switch to Graph.   Check Status/Targets - Kubernetes service discovery.         Run Grafana dashboard using the following command   istioctl dashboard grafana     Go to Dashboar-&gt;Manage-&gt;Istio and see the dashboar as below.

It will be actual adapter configuration that I mentioned earler.      Create a YAMl file and name the file fluentd-istio.yaml and write below code.   fluentd-istio.yaml   # Configuration for logentry instances apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2 kind: instance metadata:   name: newlog   namespace: istio-system spec:   compiledTemplate: logentry   params:     severity: '\"info\"'     timestamp: request.time     variables:       source: source.labels[\"app\"] | source.workload.name | \"unknown\"       user: source.user | \"unknown\"       destination: destination.labels[\"app\"] | destination.workload.name | \"unknown\"       responseCode: response.code | 0       responseSize: response.size | 0       latency: response.duration | \"0ms\"     monitored_resource_type: '\"UNSPECIFIED\"' --- # Configuration for a Fluentd handler apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2 kind: handler metadata:   name: handler   namespace: istio-system spec:   compiledAdapter: fluentd   params:     address: \"fluentd-es.kube-system:24224\" --- # Rule to send logentry instances to the Fluentd handler apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2 kind: rule metadata:   name: newlogtofluentd   namespace: istio-system spec:   match: \"true\" # match for all requests   actions:    - handler: handler      instances:      - newlog ---       Apply the below command   kubectl apply -f fluentd-istio.yaml      Filter on search with kubernetes.container.name is istio-proxy  and we will see logs fron istio proxy.

        "excerpt":"  Introduction   Swagger configuration on API gateway is not as simple as you are configure normal application. You have to configure it in different way. In this article I will create an API gateway using ocelot and asp.net core application and show you how to configure swagger on API gateway.   Tools and technologies used     Visual Studio 2022   .NET 6.0   In Memory Database   Entity Framework   ASP.NET Core Web API   C#   Ocelot and   MMLib.SwaggerForOcelot   Implementation   Step 1: Create solution and projects.      Create a solution name APIGateway   Add 4 new web api project, name - Catalog.API, Location.API, Ordering.API and BFF.Web in the solution.   Here, BFF.Web project will act as API Gateway.   Step 2: Install nuget packages.      Install following nuget package in Catalog.API Project   PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools      Install following nuget package in Ordering.API Project   PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools      Install following nuget packages in BFF.Web Project   PM&gt; Install-Package Ocelot PM&gt; Install-Package Ocelot.Provider.Polly PM&gt; Install-Package Ocelot.Cache.CacheManager PM&gt; Install-Package MMLib.SwaggerForOcelot   Step 3: Organize Catalog.API Project      Create a Product model class in Catalog.API/Model folder   Product.cs    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

        "excerpt":"Overview   Jenkins is an open source automation server to facilitate CI/CD. It helps to automate software development jobs like building, testing, and deploying. In this article we are going to show you how to configure CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Github for an ASP.NET Core Web API application.   Tools and Technology used  The following tools and technologies are used to configure CI/CD      Visual Studio 2022   Visual C#   ASP.NET Core Web API   Jenkins   Github   IIS   Let’s configure Jenkins for an asp.net core web api applications.   Step 1: Download and install Java   Jenkin is developed by Java. So it needs Java runtime to run. Download and install latest version of Java SDK from here   Step 2: Download Jenkins      Download Jenkins from here   Click Download -&gt; Download Jenkins 2.332.1 LTS for: -&gt; Windows   Step 3: Install Jenkins on Windows      Double click on Jenkins.msi file and Click Next   Choose Logon Type (I have choosen Run Service as LocalSystem) and clik next.   Type a port number or keep default 8080 (I have choosen 8080). Click Test port and Next.   Once the installation is done. Navigate to the URL http://localhost:8080/ . You will get an screen mentioned Unlock Jenkins.   Go to the file mentioned in the screen and copy and pest the password on Andminstrator Password text box and click continue.   Now you will get the following screen and click on Install suggested plugins.         Wait untill all plugins are installed. If any plugins installation is failed, try again. Once installation is done, you will see the following screen.         Fill up the form, type user name and passwrod, and click Save &amp; Continue.   You will get the another screen, clik Save &amp; Finish.   Now our jenkins is ready. Click Start using Jenkins.   Step 4: To avoid a login each time do the following      Navigate Manage Jenkins -&gt; Configure Global Security   Mark “Allow anonymous read access” as below      Step 5: Install some custom plugins      Navigate to “Manage Jenkins” -&gt; “Manage Plugins”   Click “Available” tab   Install MSBuild, MSTest, MSTestRunner, PowerShell, VSTestRunner and Git plugin if those are not already installed.   You can use search field to find out the plugins.   Now click Install without restart.   Step 6: Create an asp.net core web api project   Step 6.1: Create an Web api project      Create a ASP.NET Core Web API Project Name HRM.API. Keep Solution name as HRM.   Step 6.2: Install the nuget packages      Install the following nuget packages on HRM.API project.   PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 6.0.3 PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory 6.0.3   Step 6.3: Create model class      Create a model class name - Employee in Models folder.

Program.cs   using HRM.API.Db; using HRM.API.Repository; using HRM.API.Services; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container.  // Configure in memory database builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;HRMContext&gt;(opt =&gt; opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"HRMDB\"));  builder.Services.AddControllers(); // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();   //Register DI builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IEmployeeRepository, EmployeeRepository&gt;(); builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IEmployeeService, EmployeeService&gt;();   var app = builder.Build();   // 2. Find the service within the scope to use using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope()) {     // 3. Get the instance of HRMContext in our service layer     var services = scope.ServiceProvider;     var context = services.GetRequiredService&lt;HRMContext&gt;();      // 4. Call the SeedDataGenerator to generate seed data     SeedDataGenerator.Initialize(services); }    // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     //app.UseSwagger();     //app.UseSwaggerUI(); }  // To show both development and deployment app.UseSwagger(); app.UseSwaggerUI();  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  app.Run();    Step 7: Create a publish profile on our application      Click right button on the HRM.API Project -&gt; Click Publish.   Click ‘+’ sign to create a profile.   Select Folder and click Next.   Release location is like - bin\\Release\\net6.0\\publish\\   Click Finish   From “more action” rename the profile as - JenkinsProfile        You will see two folders are created in Properties -&gt; PublishProfiles folder. Their name is - JenkinsProfile.pubxml and JenkinsProfile.pubxml.user       Modify the pubxml file in Properties/PublishProfiles/JnekinsProfile.pubxml   Change WebPublishMethod to Package from FileSystem as like below.   &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt; &lt;!-- https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=208121.  --&gt; &lt;Project ToolsVersion=\"4.0\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\"&gt;   &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;     &lt;DeleteExistingFiles&gt;False&lt;/DeleteExistingFiles&gt;     &lt;ExcludeApp_Data&gt;False&lt;/ExcludeApp_Data&gt;     &lt;LaunchSiteAfterPublish&gt;True&lt;/LaunchSiteAfterPublish&gt;     &lt;LastUsedBuildConfiguration&gt;Release&lt;/LastUsedBuildConfiguration&gt;     &lt;LastUsedPlatform&gt;Any CPU&lt;/LastUsedPlatform&gt;     &lt;PublishProvider&gt;FileSystem&lt;/PublishProvider&gt;     &lt;PublishUrl&gt;bin\\Release\\net6.0\\publish\\&lt;/PublishUrl&gt;     &lt;WebPublishMethod&gt;Package&lt;/WebPublishMethod&gt;   &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;/Project&gt;      Commit and push this changes on the github.   Step 8: Create a test project name HRM.Test on the same solution      Add necessary test cases for HRM.API   Step 9: Build and Run Unit Test cases localy      To build the application locally. Go to the directory of the HRM.API applycation where solution file exists.   Run the following command on terminal to build the application.   PS D:\\Projects\\Github\\code-sample02\\jenkins-demo\\HRM&gt; dotnet build .\\HRM.sln      To Run unit test locally go the directory where test project file exists and run the following command.   PS D:\\Projects\\Github\\code-sample02\\jenkins-demo\\HRM\\HRM.Test&gt; dotnet test .\\HRM.Test.csproj   Step 10: Install Microsoft Web Deploy      Download and install latest version of Microsoft web deploy, if it is not already installed. In my case, it is already installed with visual studio 2022.   Step 11: Create Credentials Id      Navigate to “Manage Jenkins” -&gt; Manage Credentials -&gt; Click Jenkins -&gt; Click Global Credentials (Unrestricted) -&gt; Click Adding some credentials.         In this case, I have given my Github user name and password.   Fill the form and click OK   Id will be generated automatically.   Back to Global credentials (unrestricted) and click Update. You will get ID here.   Step 12: Create Pipeline using Jenkins      Click “Create a job” on the Jenkins home page.         Select Pipeline of the next screen, give a name of the pipeline, I am giving the name of pipeline is “HRMPipelines” and Click Ok.         Now add follwoing script on Pipleline section as mentioned below.      pipeline {    agent any    environment {     dotnet = 'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\dotnet\\\\dotnet.exe'    }    stages {     stage('Checkout') {      steps {        git credentialsId: 'aee7d65a-33a7-4616-ab5e-4a1598289b1b', url: 'https://github.com/mahedee/code-sample02.git', branch: 'main'    }     }    stage('Build') {      steps {       bat 'dotnet build %WORKSPACE%\\\\jenkins-demo\\\\HRM\\\\HRM.sln --configuration Release'      //bat 'dotnet build C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Jenkins\\\\.jenkins\\\\workspace\\\\HRMPipelines\\\\jenkins-demo\\\\HRM\\\\HRM.sln --configuration Release'      }     }     stage('Test') {      steps {       bat 'dotnet test %WORKSPACE%\\\\jenkins-demo\\\\HRM\\\\HRM.Test\\\\HRM.Test.csproj --logger:trx'      }     }      stage(\"Release\"){       steps {       bat 'dotnet build  %WORKSPACE%\\\\jenkins-demo\\\\HRM\\\\HRM.sln /p:PublishProfile=\" %WORKSPACE%\\\\jenkins-demo\\\\HRM\\\\HRM.API\\\\Properties\\\\PublishProfiles\\\\JenkinsProfile.pubxml\" /p:Platform=\"Any CPU\" /p:DeployOnBuild=true /m'     }   }      stage('Deploy') {     steps {     // Stop IIS     bat 'net stop \"w3svc\"'          // Deploy package to IIS     bat '\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\IIS\\\\Microsoft Web Deploy V3\\\\msdeploy.exe\" -verb:sync -source:package=\"%WORKSPACE%\\\\jenkins-demo\\\\HRM\\\\HRM.API\\\\bin\\\\Debug\\\\net6.0\\\\HRM.API.zip\" -dest:auto -setParam:\"IIS Web Application Name\"=\"HRM.Web\" -skip:objectName=filePath,absolutePath=\".\\\\\\\\PackageTmp\\\\\\\\Web.config$\" -enableRule:DoNotDelete -allowUntrusted=true'          // Start IIS again     bat 'net start \"w3svc\"'     }  }   }   }    This is the sequential script for the pipeline to execute the stages one by one. Here we used 5 steps - Checkout, Build, Test, Release, Deploy   Stage 1 - Checkout: In this stage, we provide the URL and Git repository, branch as main and git credentials id. Which I have created on step 10. I pull the source code to workspace. Default workspace is - C:\\ProgramData\\Jenkins.jenkins\\workspace   Stage 2 - Build: In this stage, I have build the specific project. Here HRM.API. Keep in mind you have to direct the location where sln file exists.   Stage 3 - Test : In this stage, I have run test project providing test project link.   Stage 4 - Release: In this stage, A release package HRM.zip is created in the mentioned location which is provided on JenkinsProfile.pubxml. You may check each steps output using console after executing pipeline.   Stage 5 - Deploy: In this tage, first stop IIS. Then deploy package to IIS and then Start IIS again. So, I have used three bat command here.   Step 13: Configure Build Triggers      Navigate to HRMPipelines -&gt; Build Triggers   Mark GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling and Pool SCM   Type schedule as * * * * *  which means, keep checking the Git repository and as soon as commit/check-in is done, trigger the build process. Note: there is a space after each star.              You can use  */15 * * * * if you want to run pipeline after 15 minutes of push on main.            Click Save       Step 14: Run pipeline manually      Go to the dashboard   Click HRMPipelines   Click Build Now and you will see the following screen. It means, build and deployment completed sucessfully.      Step 15: Change application and see output      Change a little bit on your application   Commit and push it to the Github   Wait a bit and you will see the build and deployed successfully.   Now test your application using the following URL:   http://localhost:8012/swagger/index.html      Here I have hosted the application on 8012 port on IIS.

        "title": "How to create SSH fingerprint for Azure DevOps",
        "excerpt":"Azure DevOps is a cloud-based platform provided by Microsoft that offers a set of development tools and services for software development teams. It provides a comprehensive set of features to plan, develop, test, and deliver applications efficiently. Azure DevOps integrates with popular development tools and provides a seamless end-to-end experience for managing the entire software development lifecycle.   The core components of Azure DevOps include:           Azure Boards: This component provides agile project management capabilities, including work item tracking, backlog management, sprint planning, and reporting. It allows teams to plan, track, and discuss work across the entire development process.            Azure Repos: Azure Repos is a version control system that supports both Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). It provides reliable and scalable repository management for source code, enabling collaboration, branching, merging, and pull request workflows.            Azure Pipelines: Azure Pipelines is a powerful continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. It allows teams to automate build, test, and deployment processes for applications across different platforms and environments. It supports a wide range of languages, platforms, and deployment targets.            Azure Test Plans: This component provides comprehensive testing tools for manual and exploratory testing. It enables teams to plan, track, and manage test cases and provides rich reporting capabilities to measure test coverage and identify issues.            Azure Artifacts: Azure Artifacts is a package management system that allows teams to create, host, and share NuGet, npm, and Maven packages within the organization. It provides a centralized location to manage and distribute dependencies and artifacts across the development pipeline.       On the other hand, SSH, which stands for Secure Shell, is a network protocol that provides a secure and encrypted way to access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. It is commonly used for remote administration of servers, secure file transfers, and secure tunneling of network services.   Here are some key aspects of SSH:           Secure Communication: SSH provides a secure channel over an insecure network by encrypting all the data exchanged between the client and the server. This ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials and data transfers, is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.            Authentication: SSH uses various methods for user authentication, including password-based authentication and public-key authentication. Public-key authentication is generally considered more secure and involves generating a key pair consisting of a private key (kept on the client) and a public key (uploaded to the server).            Port Forwarding and Tunneling: SSH allows for port forwarding, also known as SSH tunneling, which enables the secure forwarding of network connections from a local computer to a remote server or vice versa. This feature is useful for accessing services on remote machines or bypassing firewall restrictions.            Remote Shell Access: SSH provides a secure command-line interface (CLI) or shell access to remote systems. This allows system administrators and users to execute commands, manage files, and perform administrative tasks on remote servers as if they were directly interacting with the local machine.            Secure File Transfer: SSH includes the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and Secure Copy (SCP) utilities, which allow secure file transfers between the client and the server. These utilities provide encryption and integrity checks to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transferred files.       Creating an SSH fingerprint and connecting to Azure DevOps or GitHub may appear straightforward at first, but occasionally, we encounter challenging issues. In this step-by-step guide, I will demonstrate the process of generating an SSH fingerprint for Azure DevOps and cloning a repository.   Step 1:Create SSH Keys      Create a folder if not exists - name .ssh in the following directory.   C:\\Users\\mahedee           Go to run and type: %userprofile%\\.ssh            Run the powershell command in the following directory.       C:\\Users\\mahedee\\.ssh      Run the follwing command on powershell.   ssh-keygen -C \"test-git-dev-azure.com\"      Step 2: Add the public key to Azure DevOps      Now go to the Azure DevOps web portal. Go to the avatar on the upper right corner. Select SSH public keys.         Select + New Key button on the upper right corner.         Copy the key from C:\\Users\\mahedee\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub . The content of the id_rsa.pub file that you have already generated and pest the content on Public Key Data text box as belows.         Now click add button.

        "title": "Configure QoS in API Gateway using ocelot and Polly",
        "excerpt":"Introduction  API Gateway is an entry point for backend application. It maintains routing, authentication, logging, service discovery etc. Ocelot is used to design and develop API gateway for .net based application. QoS is generally configured in API gateway which provides different priorities for different applications, users or traffic. In this article, we will configure and discuss Quality of Services (QoS) using ocelot and Polly on ASP.NET Core web API project.   What is Quality of Service (QoS)?  QoS provides different priorities to different applications, users or data flow. We have already mentioned, Ocelot is used to design API Gateway and Ocelot uses Polly to achieve QoS.   The QoSOptions node contains three important properties.          ExceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking  This value must greater than 0. It means that the circuit breaker will break after a certain number of exceptions occur. For example:            DurationOfBreak  This value specifies how long the circuit breaker will stay open after it is tripped. The unit of this value is milliseconds. For example: 5000 means 5 seconds            TimeoutValue  This value specifies that a request will automatically be timed out if it takes more than this value. The unit of this value is milliseconds as well. For example: 3000 means 3 seconds.

Create a folder name - Routes.dev in root directory and add the following files.  ocelot.catalog-api.json, ocelot.global.json, ocelot.SwaggerEndPoints.json in Routes.dev folder.            Now modify the json files as follows.       ocelot.catalog-api.json    {   \"Routes\": [     {       \"DownstreamPathTemplate\": \"/{everything}\",       \"DownstreamScheme\": \"https\",       \"SwaggerKey\": \"catalog-api\",       \"DownstreamHostAndPorts\": [         {           \"Host\": \"localhost\",           \"Port\": \"7282\"         }       ],       \"UpstreamPathTemplate\": \"/catalog/{everything}\",       \"UpstreamHttpMethod\": [         \"GET\",         \"POST\",         \"PUT\",         \"DELETE\"       ],        \"QoSOptions\": {         \"ExceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking\": 2,         \"DurationOfBreak\": 5000,         \"TimeoutValue\": 3000       }      }   ] }    QoSOptions section of the above file basically configure QoS for Catalog service. The above configuration means that if the server does not response for 3 minutes, it will throw timeout exception. If the server throws two exceptions, it will not be accessible for five minutes.   ocelot.global.json    {   \"GlobalConfiguration\": {     \"BaseUrl\": \"https://localhost:7205\"     //\"ServiceDiscoveryProvider\": {      //  \"Host\": \"localhost\",     //  \"Port\": 7205     //}   } }   ocelot.SwaggerEndPoints.json    {   \"SwaggerEndPoints\": [     {       \"Key\": \"bffweb\",       \"TransformByOcelotConfig\": false,       \"Config\": [         {           \"Name\": \"BFF.Web\",           \"Version\": \"1.0\",           \"Url\": \"https://localhost:7205/swagger/v1/swagger.json\"         }       ]     },      {       \"Key\": \"catalog-api\",       \"TransformByOcelotConfig\": true,       \"Config\": [         {           \"Name\": \"Catalog.API\",           \"Version\": \"1.0\",           \"Url\": \"https://localhost:7205/catalog/swagger/v1/swagger.json\"         }       ]     }   ] }     Note: I have added the following code block in CatalogItemController to produce timeout manually.           [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;CatalogItem&gt;&gt;&gt; GetCatalogItems()         {             _count++;             if(_count &lt;= 3)             {                 // Sleep for 4 seconds                 Thread.Sleep(4000);             }              if (_context.CatalogItems == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return await _context.CatalogItems.ToListAsync();         }    Step 5: Run and test the application   Now run both web projects. In the BFF.Web, select Catalog.API-1.0 from swagger definition (“Select a definition on the top right corner”) and execute the api (CatalogItems) as follows.      When we visit the first time (or quickly second time), it tells us that circuit is breaking for 5000 ms. Look at the console of BFF.Web.      Then, the second time (quickly) it tells us that the circuit is open, and we cannot visit the service for 3 seconds as follows.      After 3 seconds, the service is accessible. If you execute now, you will see the output like below.      Source code  ","categories": ["C#","ASP.NET Core","Web API","Microservices","Ocelot","Poly"],

        "title": "Service Discovery using Eureka, Ocelot and ASP.net core",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   Service discovery is a process in microservice architecture that enables dynamic registration and lookup of services in a network environment. It allows microservices to discover each other, establish communication, and collaborate to complete a task. This helps to improve resilience, scalability, and flexibility of microservice-based systems. In this article, I will show you how to configure service discovery with ocelot in API gateway.   Service discovery implementations within microservices architecture discovery includes both:      a central server (or servers) that maintain a global view of addresses.   clients that connect to the central server to update and retrieve addresses.   It is always hard to manage lots of micro services as well as had to maintain tens or hundreds of LB’s and DNS records. In a microservice architecture, service lifespan is measured in seconds and minutes. With microservices, addresses are added and changed constantly as new hosts are added, ports are changed, or services are terminated. The highly transient nature of microservices is again pushing the limits of today’s technologies, and we see different organizations adopting different strategies.      Fig – Real world problem (Collected from internet)      Fig – Service discovery pattern (Collected from internet)   What is Eureka Server?  Eureka is a popular, open-source service registry software used to implement the service discovery pattern in microservice architecture. It is actually Netflix OSS product, and spring cloud offers a declarative way to register and invoke services by Java annotation. It provides a centralized registry of microservices, enabling services to dynamically discover each other without hardcoding the addresses. In a typical setup, microservices register themselves with the Eureka server, providing information such as their hostname and IP address. Other microservices can then query the Eureka server to discover the endpoint of the microservice they need to communicate with.  Eureka also provides some additional features such as load balancing, failover, and health checks to ensure high availability and reliability of the microservices.   Implementation   Let’s implement Service Discovery using Ocelot and asp.net core   Tools and Technologies Used     Visual Studio 2022   .NET 6.0   ASP.NET Core Web API   Visual C#   Eureka   Step 1: Create solution and projects      Create a solution name SDDemo.sln   Add four Web Api Projects name BFF.Web, Customer.API, Location.API, Product.API   Here BFF.Web is an api gateway   Step 2: Install nuget packages      Install following nuget packages in BFF.Web project    PM&gt; Install-Package MMLib.SwaggerForOcelot PM&gt; Install-Package Ocelot PM&gt; Install-Package Ocelot.Provider.Eureka PM&gt; Install-Package Ocelot.Provider.Polly PM&gt; Install-Package Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka       Install following nuget packages in Customer.API project   PM&gt; Install-Package Steeltoe.Discovery.ClientCore PM&gt; Install-Package Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka      Install following nuget packages in Location.API project   PM&gt; Install-Package Steeltoe.Discovery.ClientCore PM&gt; Install-Package Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka      Install following nuget packages in Product.API project   PM&gt; Install-Package Steeltoe.Discovery.ClientCore PM&gt; Install-Package Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka   Step 3: Organize Customer.API projects      Register Eureka and modify program.cs as follows.

        "title": "How to handle Idempotentcy in distributed system using asp.net core",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   In a distributed application, idempotent operation or idempotency refers to the property of an operation such that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. This is useful in situations where a request may be lost or a response may be delayed, as it allows the client to retry the request without worrying about producing unintended side effects.   For example, consider a distributed system that allows users to transfer money between accounts. If a client sends a request to transfer $100 from account A to account B, but the request is lost before it is received by the server, the client may not know whether the transfer was successful or not. If the transfer operation is idempotent, the client can simply retry the request, and the server will ensure that the transfer is performed only once, regardless of the number of times the request is received.   There are several approaches to solving idempotency in distributed systems:   1. Versioning: As mentioned earlier, versioning is a technique where the server stores a version number for each resource and only performs an operation if the version number has not changed since the client’s last request. This allows the server to detect and ignore duplicate requests.   2. Request IDs:   Another approach is to assign a unique request ID to each request and store a record of all request IDs that have been processed by the server. If the server receives a request with a request ID that it has already processed, it can simply ignore the request.   3. Locking:   In some cases, it may be necessary to use locks to ensure that only one instance of an operation is in progress at a time. For example, a distributed lock could be used to prevent multiple clients from concurrently transferring money from the same account.   4. State reconciliation:   In a distributed system, it is possible for the state of a resource to become inconsistent due to lost or delayed requests. One way to solve this problem is to use state reconciliation, where the server periodically checks the state of all resources and reconciles any inconsistencies.   In this article I will show you how to handle idempotent operation using asp.net core. Here, I have created a request Id (idempotencyKey here) and check whether it is already exists within a time period.   Implementation:  Let’s implement idempotency using asp.net core.   Tools and Technologies used:     Visual Studio 2022   Visual C#   SQL Server   Redis   .NET 6.0   ASP.NET Core Web API   Step 1: Setup and run Redis in docker container.      Run Redis docker image using the following command.   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name myredis --network redisnet redis      You can use Redis desktop manager as client of Redis   Step 2: Create solution and project      Create a solution name IdempotentDemo using visual studio   Create a new web api project name Accounting.API   Step 3: Install nuget packages      Install following nuget packages in Accounting.API   PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis   Step 4: Add connection string for SQL server and Redis      Modify appsettings.json as follows   appsettings.json   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\"     }   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\",   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"AccountingDBConnection\": \"Server=localhost;Database=AccountingDB;User Id=sa;Password=yourdbserverpassword;\"   },   //Redis Server   \"Redis\": {     \"Server\": \"localhost:6379\"   } }    Step 5: Create model TransactionDetails class in Models folder   TransactionDetails.cs    namespace Accounting.API.Models {     public class TransactionDetails     {         public Int64 Id { get; set; }          // Master transaction Id         public Int64 TransactionId { get; set; }                  // Id against GL Code         public int AccountId { get; set; }           public decimal DrAmount { get; set; }         public decimal CrAmount { get; set; }          // Cash = 1, Cheque = 2         public int TransactionType { get; set; }          // Any note         public string Description { get; set; }      } }    Step 6: Create DbContext class in Db folder as follows.   AccountingContext.cs   using Accounting.API.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace Accounting.API.Db {     public class AccountingContext : DbContext     {         public AccountingContext(DbContextOptions&lt;AccountingContext&gt; options) : base(options)         {          }          public DbSet&lt;TransactionDetails&gt; TransactionDetails { get; set; }     } }    Step 7: Register Redis Caching server and SQL server in Program.cs file as follows.

              // check hash key is exists in the redis cache             var isCached = await _distributedCache.GetAsync(idempotencyKey).ConfigureAwait(false);              if(isCached is not null)             {                 // if same value is already exists in the cache then return existing value.                  var decodedResult = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;TransactionDetails&gt;(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(isCached));

            }               // Save into database             _context.TransactionDetails.Add(transactionDetails);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              // Set value into cache after save             // value will be removed after 10 mins             // It will be removed after 2 mins, if it is not requested within 2 mins              var options = new DistributedCacheEntryOptions().SetAbsoluteExpiration(DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(10)).SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2));             await _distributedCache.SetAsync(idempotencyKey,                 Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(transactionDetails)), options);               return CreatedAtAction(\"GetTransactionDetails\", new { id = transactionDetails.Id }, transactionDetails);         }          // DELETE: api/TransactionDetails/5         [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteTransactionDetails(long id)         {             if (_context.TransactionDetails == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             var transactionDetails = await _context.TransactionDetails.FindAsync(id);             if (transactionDetails == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              _context.TransactionDetails.Remove(transactionDetails);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              return NoContent();         }          private bool TransactionDetailsExists(long id)         {             return (_context.TransactionDetails?.Any(e =&gt; e.Id == id)).GetValueOrDefault();         }     } }    Step 10: Now run application and save data using swagger UI.      Try to save same data twice or more   Check database, you will see data will save one once   Now look at the PostTransactionDetails class. Here I have created idempotencyKey (a hash key) using transaction id, debit amount and credit amount. In this case, idempotencyKey is actually request key. When we save any data, we are storing a request key of corresponding input in redis cache. Whenever, we are going to save data we are checking hash key of existing input. If it is existing then it will not save and consider as idempotent operation.   DistributedCacheEntryOptions           SetAbsoluteExpiration: Here you can set the expiration time of the cached object.            SetSlidingExpiration: This is similar to Absolute Expiration. It expires as a cached object if it not being requested for a defined amount of time period. Note that Sliding Expiration should always be set lower than the absolute expiration       Note: In distributed caching, cache is not stored in to an individual web server’s memory. Cache data is centrally managed and the same data is available to all the app servers. The distributed caching has several advantages, as shown below. The cache is stored centrally, so all the users get the same data and data is not dependent on which web server handles its request. The cache data is not impacted if any problem happens with the web server; i.e.,  restart, new server is added, a server is removed.

        "title": "What and why IValidatebleObject in C#",
        "excerpt":"IValidatableObject is an interface in C# that defines a method named Validate, which enables an object to perform custom validation logic. When you implement this interface in a class, you can add custom validation logic to that class.   The Validate method defined in IValidatableObject takes no parameters and returns an IEnumerable. The method can perform any validation logic and return an enumerable collection of ValidationResult objects that represent the validation errors or warnings. If the object is valid, the Validate method should return an empty collection.   The Validate method is called automatically when you use the Validator class to validate an object. You can also call the Validate method directly if you want to perform custom validation logic.   Here is an example of a class that implements IValidatableObject.   Step 1: Create a console application and a class name Employee as follows.   Employee.cs    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;  namespace IValidatebleObjectDemo {     public class Employee : IValidatableObject     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public bool Status { get; set; }         public int DesignationId { get; set; }          public IEnumerable&lt;ValidationResult&gt; Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)         {             if(Id &lt;= 0)             {                 yield return new ValidationResult(\"Employee Id is a required filed!\", new[] {\"Id\"});             }              if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(Name))             {                 yield return new ValidationResult(\"Employee Name is a required field!\", new[] { \"Name\" });             }         }     } }    The above code defines an Employee class that implements the IValidatableObject interface in C#. The Employee class has four properties - Id, Name, Status, and DesignationId.   The Validate method is used to perform custom validation logic on the Employee object. The method checks if the Id property is less than or equal to zero and if the Name property is null or empty. If either of these conditions is true, the method returns a ValidationResult object that contains an error message and the name of the property that failed validation.   The ValidationResult class is part of the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace, which provides a set of validation attributes and classes that can be used to validate data in a .NET application. In this case, the ValidationResult class is used to represent the result of a validation check, and the yield return statement is used to return the ValidationResult object to the caller. By using yield return instead of adding the validation results to a collection and returning the collection at the end of the method, the Validate method can return the validation results one at a time as they are generated, without needing to generate the entire sequence of results up front.   Step 2: Validate Employee class using the following code.   Program.cs    using IValidatebleObjectDemo; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;  var result = new List&lt;ValidationResult&gt;(); bool validateAllProperties = false; bool isValid = false;  var employee = new Employee() {     Id = 1,     Name = \"Mahedee Hasan\",     Status = true,     DesignationId = 1 };   isValid = Validator.TryValidateObject(employee, new ValidationContext(employee, null, null),      result, validateAllProperties);  var employee2 = new Employee() {     Id = -1,     Name = null,     Status = true,     DesignationId = 1 };  isValid = Validator.TryValidateObject(employee2, new ValidationContext(employee2, null, null),      result, validateAllProperties);       The code block of step 2 performs object validation using the Validator.TryValidateObject method from the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace.   Here, List object is created to store any validation errors that are generated during the validation process.   The Validator.TryValidateObject method is then called with the employee object, a new instance of ValidationContext, the result list, and the validateAllProperties boolean variable. This method attempts to validate the employee object based on the validation rules defined in the Employee class’s Validate method. Here you will see employee object is valid and there is no element in result list and isValid is ture.   But, second instance of the Employee class with some invalid data and calls the Validator.TryValidateObject method again with this object. You will see two error in the result list and isValid is false.   Overall, this code demonstrates how to use IValidatebleObject to perform object validation in C# application using validation rules defined in the object’s validation method.

        "title": "How to create .Net custom template using GitHub Packages Registry",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   .NET gives us opportunity to create custom template for future use and GitHub packages registry is most popular now a days to host custom template. In this article, I will show you how to create .net custom template using GitHub packages registry.   Tools and Technology uses     Visual Studio 2022   .NET 6   Visual C#   GitHub   Implementation   Step 1: Create a personal access token (PAT) from GitHub      Login into you GitHub   Go to settings -&gt; Developer Settings -&gt; Personal Access Tokens   Click “Generate new token” button   Type Note for the token, expiration days   Select scope for the token – here I have selected repo, write:packages, delete:packages as shown below.         Now click “Generate Token” at the bottom of the panel   Copy the token and store the token for further use because you cannot find it later      Step – 2: Add Nuget Source in visual studio      Type the following command to add source   dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/mahedee/index.json --name github-mahedee --username mahedee --password &lt;Your personal Access Token&gt;           You will see a source is added in C:\\Users\\mahedee\\AppData\\Roaming\\NuGet\\NuGet.Config file       You can add source from visual studio Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; NuGet Package Manager -&gt; Package Sources   Restart visual studio to get new nuget package source   Step – 3: Create template for your application     Create a project or multiple projects using a solution file.   Here, I have created a clean architecture template with a solution file and  multiple projects   Create a folder name – “.template.config” in the root directory of your application.         Create a file template.json in .template.config folder.   Add the following content to template.json file   template.json    {   \"$schema\": \"http://json.schemastore.org/template\",   \"author\": \"Mahedee Hasan\",   \"classifications\": [     \"dotnet\",     \"CleanArchitecture\"   ],   \"name\": \"Clean Architecture project template\",   \"description\": \"Project template to create project using Clean Architecture\",   \"identity\": \"CleanArchitecture\",   \"shortName\": \"CleanArchitecture\",   \"sourceName\": \"CleanArch\",   \"tags\": {     \"language\": \"C#\",     \"type\": \"project\"   },   \"symbols\": {     \"Framework\": {       \"type\": \"parameter\",       \"description\": \"The target framework for the project.\",       \"datatype\": \"choice\",       \"choices\": [         {           \"choice\": \"net6.0\"         },         {           \"choice\": \"net5.0\"       }       ],       \"defaultValue\": \"net6.0\",       \"replaces\": \"{TargetFramework}\"     }   } }    Step -4: Install and create template locally (Optional)      Go to one where “.template.config” folder exists.   Now run the following command. Don’t forgot to add space “.” at the end.   dotnet new --install .      You will see in the output that template is created. You will see Short Name of template which is used to install template.   Now go to the directory where you want to install template and type the following command.   dotnet new CleanArchitecture or, dotnet new CleanArchitecture --force   Here CleanArchitecture is short name of the template      To create template by another name type as follows.   dotnet new CleanArchitecture -o Location   Now projects name will be Location instead of CleanArch as mentioned in the previous json file.      Now go to the same directory to uninstall the template and type the following command.   dotnet new --uninstall .   Step - 5: Packing a template into a NuGet Package (nupkg file)      Create a .csproj file one directory up of “.template.config” folder.        In my case the folder structure as follows              Add the following content in TemplatePack.csproj project.   TemplatePack.csproj    &lt;Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\"&gt;     &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;       &lt;PackageType&gt;Template&lt;/PackageType&gt;       &lt;PackageVersion&gt;1.0.0&lt;/PackageVersion&gt;       &lt;PackageId&gt;Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates&lt;/PackageId&gt;       &lt;Title&gt;Clean Architecture Template&lt;/Title&gt;       &lt;Authors&gt;Mahedee Hasan&lt;/Authors&gt;       &lt;Description&gt;Clean Architecture Template&lt;/Description&gt;       &lt;PackageTags&gt;dotnet-new;templates;clean-architecture&lt;/PackageTags&gt;       &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netstandard2.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;       &lt;IncludeContentInPack&gt;true&lt;/IncludeContentInPack&gt;       &lt;IncludeBuildOutput&gt;false&lt;/IncludeBuildOutput&gt;       &lt;ContentTargetFolders&gt;content&lt;/ContentTargetFolders&gt;       &lt;NoWarn&gt;$(NoWarn);NU5128&lt;/NoWarn&gt;       &lt;NoDefaultExcludes&gt;true&lt;/NoDefaultExcludes&gt;      &lt;RepositoryUrl&gt;https://github.com/mahedee/public-packages&lt;/RepositoryUrl&gt;    &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;     &lt;ItemGroup&gt;      &lt;Content Include=\"CleanArchitecture\\**\\*\" Exclude=\"CleanArchitecture\\**\\bin\\**;CleanArchitecture\\**\\obj\\**\" /&gt;      &lt;Compile Remove=\"..\\**\\*\" /&gt;     &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;      &lt;/Project&gt;        To create package go to the directory where TemplatePack.csproj file exists and type the following command.   dotnet pack      You will Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates.1.0.0.nupkg file is created in bin/Debug folder.   Step 6: Now push the package to github package registry     Go to the directory where Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates.1.0.0.nupkg is exists.   Type the following command to push the package in github package registry   dotnet nuget push .\\Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates.1.0.0.nupkg --api-key &lt;Your personal access token&gt; --source github-mahedee      Here, “github-mahedee” is a github source which we have added in step – 2.   Now login your github and you will see a template is uploaded to your package registry.   Step 7: Download template and install in local machine      Run the following command to install in local machine   dotnet new --install  Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates  Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates is package Id.   output:   The following template packages will be installed:    Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates  Success: Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates::1.0.0 installed the following templates: Template Name                        Short Name         Language  Tags -----------------------------------  -----------------  --------  ------------------------ Clean Architecture project template  CleanArchitecture  [C#]      dotnet/CleanArchitecture       Now go to the directory where you want to regenerate the template and type the following command.   dotnet new CleanArchitecture   Here CleanArchitecture is the short name of the template   Note     To see installed template in locally use the following command. You will also see how to uninstall the particular template.   dotnet new --uninstall      To uninstall a particular template from local machine, use the following command.   dotnet new --uninstall Mahedee.CleanArchitecture.Templates dotnet new –uninstall &lt;package id&gt;    Source code  ","categories": ["C#","ASP.NET Core","GitHub","NuGet","Packages"],

        "title": "Application of Event Sourcing using asp.net core, DDD, EF, EventStoreDB and SQL Server",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   Event sourcing is a most important pattern to design a microservice based application. If you are working with multiple services in a microservice based application, you have to use event driven architecture. In this article I will discuss and apply event sourcing using asp.net core, DDD and EventStoreDB.   Domain Driven Design (DDD)_  Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach, focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain’s experts.  Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. (Wikipedia)   Event Sourcing  Event sourcing is a technique to store all events of an Object to get all of its versions. Event sourcing pattern is used to implement microservice based application.  Using this pattern, we can track the changes of an object in its lifecycle.   EventStoreDB  EventStoreDB specially built for Event Sourcing. It is a NoSQL database. This is a one-way database – we can only insert data into database.   Implementation  Let’s implement Event Sourcing using DDD and EventStoreDB.   Tools and Technologies Used      Visual Studio 2022   .NET 6.0   ASP.NET Core Web API   Visual C#   DDD   EventStoreDB   SQL Server   Step 1: Install EventStoreDB           You can install EventStoreDB using EventStoreDB documentation. Visit the following link : https://developers.eventstore.com/server/v20.10/installation.html#quick-start            Or, you can run docker image of EventStoreDB as below.       docker run --name esdb-node -it -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 eventstore/eventstore:latest --insecure --run-projections=All --enable-external-tcp --enable-atom-pub-over-http      Here I used docker images for EventStoreDB. After running the above command, browse EventStoreDB using the following link.   http://localhost:2113/web/index.html#/dashboard   Step 2: Create solution and projects      Create a solution name EventSourcing.   Add a new web api projects name -  Catalog.API   Add three class library projects name – Application, Domain, Infrastructure   Step 3: Install nuget packages      Install following nuget packages in Catalog.API   PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools     Install following nuget packages in Application   PM&gt; Install-Package MediatR PM&gt; Install-Package MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions PM&gt; Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json      Install following nuget packages in Infrastructure   PM&gt; Install-Package EventStore.Client.Grpc.Streams PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions PM&gt; Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions PM&gt; Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json   Step 4: Organize Domain      Create IBaseEntity interface for Base entity in Entities-&gt;Common folder.   IBaseEntity.cs   namespace Domain.Entities.Common {     /// Ref: Coverience in C#     /// &lt;summary&gt;     /// Interface for Base Entity     /// &lt;/summary&gt;     /// &lt;typeparam name=\"TKey\"&gt;&lt;/typeparam&gt;     public interface IBaseEntity&lt;out TKey&gt;     {         TKey Id { get; }     } }       Create IDomainEvent interface for domain event in Entities-&gt;Common folder   IDomainEvent.cs   namespace Domain.Entities.Common {      /// &lt;summary&gt;     /// Interface for Domain Event     /// &lt;/summary&gt;     /// &lt;typeparam name=\"TKey\"&gt;&lt;/typeparam&gt;     public interface IDomainEvent&lt;out TKey&gt;     {         public long AggregateVersion { get; }         TKey AggregateId { get; }         DateTime TimeStamp { get; }     } }       Create IAggregateRoot interface for Aggregate Root in Entities-&gt;Common folder. IAggregateRoot is the combination of IBaseEntity and IAggregateRoot   IAggregateRoot.cs   namespace Domain.Entities.Common {     /// &lt;summary&gt;     /// Interface for AggregateRoot     /// IAggregateRoot is the combination of IBaseEntity and IAggregateRoot     /// &lt;/summary&gt;     /// &lt;typeparam name=\"TKey\"&gt;&lt;/typeparam&gt;     public interface IAggregateRoot&lt;out TKey&gt; : IBaseEntity&lt;TKey&gt;     {         long Version { get; }         IReadOnlyCollection&lt;IDomainEvent&lt;TKey&gt;&gt; Events { get;  }         void ClearEvents();     } }       Create BaseEntity class for Base Aggregate Root in Entities-&gt;Common folder. BaseEntity’s properties is shared in all entity classes.   BaseEntity.cs   namespace Domain.Entities.Common {     /// &lt;summary&gt;     /// Base class for BaseAggregateRoot class     /// Shared for all entities     /// &lt;/summary&gt;     /// &lt;typeparam name=\"TKey\"&gt;&lt;/typeparam&gt;     public abstract class BaseEntity&lt;TKey&gt; : IBaseEntity&lt;TKey&gt;     {         protected BaseEntity() { }         protected BaseEntity(TKey id) =&gt; Id = id;          //Implementation of interface         public TKey Id { get; protected set; }     } }       Create BaseDomainEvent class for all domain event class in Entities-&gt;Common folder.

Here _event queue is used to queue all events of the aggregate root. AddEvent method used to add new event.   BaseAggregateRoot.cs    using System.Collections.Immutable; using System.Reflection;  namespace Domain.Entities.Common {     public abstract class BaseAggregateRoot&lt;TA, TKey&gt; : BaseEntity&lt;TKey&gt;, IAggregateRoot&lt;TKey&gt;

You may add using project file as follows.     &lt;ItemGroup&gt;     &lt;ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Domain\\Domain.csproj\" /&gt;   &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;      Create CreateCatalogItemDTO class in Common-&gt;DTOs folder   CreateCatalogItemDTO.cs    namespace Application.Common.DTOs {     public class CreateCatalogItemDTO     {         public int Id { get; set; }          public string Name { get; set; }          public string Description { get; set; }          public double Price { get; set; }          // Quantity in stock         public int AvailableStock { get; set; }          // Available stock at which we should reorder         public int RestockThreshold { get; set; }          // Maximum number of units that can be in-stock at any time (due to physicial/logistical constraints in warehouses)         public int MaxStockThreshold { get; set; }          /// &lt;summary&gt;         /// True if item is on reorder         /// &lt;/summary&gt;         public bool OnReorder { get; set; }     } }       Create UpdateCatalogItemDTO class in Common-&gt;DTOs folder   UpdateCatalogItemDTO.cs    namespace Application.Common.DTOs {     public class UpdateCatalogItemDTO     {         public Guid Id { get; private set; }          public string Name { get; set; }          public string Description { get; set; }          public double Price { get; set; }          // Quantity in stock         public int AvailableStock { get; set; }          // Available stock at which we should reorder         public int RestockThreshold { get; set; }          // Maximum number of units that can be in-stock at any time (due to physicial/logistical constraints in warehouses)         public int MaxStockThreshold { get; set; }          /// &lt;summary&gt;         /// True if item is on reorder         /// &lt;/summary&gt;         public bool OnReorder { get; set; }     } }       Create IAggregateRepository Interface in Common-&gt;Interfaces folder. This interface is used for event sourcing. Here,  AppendAsync method is used to append events to store in event store database, RehydreateAsync method is used to read all events using aggregate id and ReadEventsAsync method is used to read events as a log and return in to dictionary.   IAggregateRepository.cs   using Domain.Entities.Common;  namespace Application.Common.Interfaces {     public interface IAggregateRepository&lt;TA, TKey&gt; where TA : class, IAggregateRoot&lt;TKey&gt;     {         // Append events to store in event store database         Task AppendAsync(TA aggregate, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);          // Read all events using aggregate ID         Task&lt;TA?&gt; RehydreateAsync(TKey aggregateId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);          // Read events as a log and return into a dictionary         Task&lt;Dictionary&lt;int, object&gt;&gt; ReadEventsAsync(TKey aggregateId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);     } }       Create ICatalogItemRepository interface to insert and update into sql server. Since, we use soft delete so here delete means update of isDelete filed to 1.

        "excerpt":"Introduction   A load balancer is a component that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single server.   Eureka is a service discovery tool provided by Netflix OSS, it can be used to solve load balancing by registering all instances of a service with Eureka and having the load balancer forward traffic to those instances. The Eureka server maintains a registry of all available instances of a service, and clients of the service query the registry to obtain a list of available service instances. The load balancer can then use this information to distribute incoming requests to the available service instances.   In this article, I will show you how to configure load balancer using Eureka and ocelot in API gateway.      Fig – Load balancing architecture (Collected from internet)   Here, I am skipping service discovery.

        "title": "Introduction to the Yield Statement",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   The yield statement is a powerful construct in C# that allows you to create custom iterators. It allows you to define a method that returns a sequence of values, but instead of returning all of the values at once, it can return them one at a time as requested. This is particularly useful when working with large data sets or when you want to avoid loading all of the data into memory at once.   The yield statement works by suspending the method’s execution and returning a value to the caller. When the method is called again, it continues executing from where it left off, remembering its previous state.   Basic Usage of the Yield Statement   To use the yield statement, you need to define a method that returns an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; or IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; object. Inside the method, you can use the yield return statement to return a value from the sequence.   Here’s an example of a method that returns a sequence of integers using the yield statement:   public static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; GetNumbers() {     yield return 1;     yield return 2;     yield return 3;     yield return 4;     yield return 5; }    In this example, the GetNumbers() method defines a sequence of integers by using five yield return statements. When this method is called, it will return an IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; object that represents the sequence of integers.   You can use a foreach loop to iterate over the sequence and retrieve each value:   foreach (int num in GetNumbers()) {     Console.WriteLine(num); }   This code will output the following:   1 2 3 4 5   Advanced Usage of the Yield Statement   The yield statement can also be used with the yield break statement to stop the sequence early. Here’s an example of a method that returns a sequence of integers up to a specified limit:   public static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; GetNumbersUpTo(int limit) {     for (int i = 1; i &lt;= limit; i++)     {         yield return i;     }      yield break; }   In this example, the GetNumbersUpTo() method defines a sequence of integers up to a specified limit. It uses a for loop to generate the sequence, and then it uses the yield break statement to stop the sequence early.   You can call this method and pass in a limit to get the sequence:   foreach (int num in GetNumbersUpTo(3)) {     Console.WriteLine(num); }   This code will output the following:   1 2 3   Conclusion  The yield statement is a powerful feature in C# that allows you to define custom iterators that can return sequences of values. It can be used to create efficient and memory-friendly code when working with large data sets or when you need to retrieve data on-demand. By using the yield return and yield break statements, you can define complex sequences and stop them early when necessary.  ","categories": ["C#"],

        "title": "Extension Methods in C# - An Introduction with Examples and Output",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   Extension methods are a powerful feature in C# that allows developers to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying the original source code. This article will provide an introduction to extension methods, along with some examples and output to demonstrate how they work.   What are Extension Methods?   An extension method is a static method that is used to extend the functionality of an existing class without modifying the original class definition. Extension methods are defined in a static class and must be marked with the “this” keyword before the first parameter. This tells the compiler that the method is an extension method and can be called as if it were a member of the extended class.   Extension methods are typically used to add functionality to classes that cannot be modified directly, such as classes in the .NET Framework. They are also useful for creating reusable code that can be shared across multiple projects.   Example of Extension Method   Here’s an example of how to create an extension method that adds a new method to the String class:   public static class StringExtensions {     public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(this string value)     {         return string.IsNullOrEmpty(value);     } }    In this example, the “IsNullOrEmpty” method is added to the String class as an extension method. The method checks whether the string is null or empty and returns a boolean value.   To use the extension method, simply call it as if it were a member of the String class:   string str = null; bool result = str.IsNullOrEmpty();   In this example, the “IsNullOrEmpty” method is called on a null string. Because it is an extension method, it can be called even though the String class does not have a method with this name.   Output of the Extension Method Example   The output of the above code will be “true”, since the string “str” is null and the “IsNullOrEmpty” method returns true for null strings.   Here’s another example that demonstrates how to create an extension method that calculates the sum of an array of integers:   public static class IntExtensions {     public static int Sum(this int[] values)     {         int sum = 0;         foreach (int value in values)         {             sum += value;         }         return sum;     } }  To use the extension method, simply call it as if it were a member of the int array:  ```csharp int[] values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; int sum = values.Sum();    In this example, the “Sum” method is called on an int array. Because it is an extension method, it can be called even though the int class does not have a method with this name.   Output of the Extension Method Example   The output of the above code will be “15”, since the “Sum” method calculates the sum of the values in the array.   Another Example    using System;  namespace ExtensionMethodsExample {     public static class MathExtensions     {         public static double RoundTo(this double number, int decimalPlaces)         {             double multiplier = Math.Pow(10, decimalPlaces);             return Math.Round(number * multiplier) / multiplier;         }          public static int Factorial(this int number)         {             if (number == 0 || number == 1)             {                 return 1;             }             else             {                 return number * Factorial(number - 1);             }         }     }      class Program     {         static void Main(string[] args)         {             double pi = 3.141592653589793;             double roundedPi = pi.RoundTo(4);             Console.WriteLine($\"Pi rounded to 4 decimal places: {roundedPi}\");              int num = 5;             int factorial = num.Factorial();             Console.WriteLine($\"Factorial of {num}: {factorial}\");         }     } }    In this example, we have created a static class called “MathExtensions” that contains two extension methods: “RoundTo” and “Factorial”.   The “RoundTo” method takes a double number and an integer number of decimal places, and returns the number rounded to the specified number of decimal places.   The “Factorial” method takes an integer number and calculates its factorial.   In the Main method, we have created a double variable “pi” and called the “RoundTo” method on it to round it to 4 decimal places. We have also created an integer variable “num” and called the “Factorial” method on it to calculate its factorial.   The output of this code will be:   Pi rounded to 4 decimal places: 3.1416 Factorial of 5: 120   This advanced example demonstrates how extension methods can be used to add complex functionality to existing classes, such as calculating the factorial of an integer or rounding a double to a specified number of decimal places.   Conclusion   Extension methods are a powerful feature in C# that allow developers to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying the original source code. They are defined in a static class and must be marked with the “this” keyword before the first parameter. Extension methods are typically used to add functionality to classes that cannot be modified directly, such as classes in the .NET Framework.

        "title": "JavaScript setInterval method with some example",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   JavaScript provides a built-in method called setInterval that allows you to execute a function or a piece of code repeatedly at a specified time interval. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as updating the content of a webpage, polling a server for new data, or animating an element on the page.   Examples   To use setInterval, you simply need to pass a function or a code block as the first argument, and the time interval (in milliseconds) as the second argument. Here’s a simple example:   setInterval(() =&gt; {   console.log(\"Hello, world!\"); }, 1000);    In this example, the setInterval method will execute the arrow function every 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second), logging the message “Hello, world!” to the console.   You can also pass a regular function as the first argument to setInterval, like this:   function sayHello() {   console.log(\"Hello, world!\"); } setInterval(sayHello, 1000);   This code will have the same effect as the previous example, but using a named function instead of an arrow function.   Another useful feature of setInterval is that it returns a unique ID that you can use to stop the interval using the clearInterval method. Here’s an example:   const intervalID = setInterval(() =&gt; {   console.log(\"Hello, world!\"); }, 1000);  setTimeout(() =&gt; {   clearInterval(intervalID); }, 5000);   In this code, we store the interval ID returned by setInterval in a variable called intervalID. Then, after 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds) have elapsed, we use the clearInterval method to stop the interval by passing the intervalID variable as an argument.   Finally, you can also pass arguments to the function being executed by setInterval. Here’s an example:   let count = 0; function incrementCount(step) {   count += step;   console.log(`Count is now ${count}`); }  setInterval(incrementCount, 1000, 2);   In this example, we’re using the incrementCount function to increment a count variable by a specified step. We pass the value 2 as the third argument to setInterval, which is then passed as the step argument to incrementCount.   These are just a few examples of how you can use the setInterval method in JavaScript to execute code at a specified time interval. Whether you’re updating the content of a webpage or animating an element, setInterval is a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals.   ","categories": ["JavaScript"],

        "title": "Singleton design pattern using C#",
        "excerpt":"Design Pattern   A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Design patterns are typically documented in a standardized format, making it easy for developers to understand and apply them to their own software projects. It is like a template to solve a problem.   Singleton Design Pattern   The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restrict to create object more than once and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when you want to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and used throughout the entire application.   The Singleton pattern is used when you want to:      Ensure that only one instance of a class is created.   Provide a single point of access to that instance.   Manage a shared resource.   Some downside of implementing the Singleton Pattern are      It can make unit testing more challenging since it introduces a global state to the application.   It limiting potential parallelism in the program through the use of locking.   In C#, there are several methods to implement a singleton pattern. The singleton pattern commonly includes the following attributes:      A single constructor that is private and has no parameters.   A sealed class.   A static variable that holds a reference to the single instance that is created.   A public and static method that provides access to the created instance.   Implementation of Singleton by C#   Step 1: Create EmployeeInfo class   This poco class is to hold employee information.        public class Employee     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public int Age { get; set; }     }   Step 2: Create a singleton class   Here EmployeeService is a singleton class. Constructor of this class is private so that nobody can create its instance from outside.  Instance() is a static method which creates instance of the singleton class. It actually forces that only one instance of the object will be created. Lock() is used to create instance of the singleton pattern in thread safe manner in multi threaded environment. The other two methods are used to add employee information in list and get employee salary. These two are as usual method.Don’t mix up Singleton class and Static class. Keep in mind; in static class everything must be static like Method, constructor, properties. But in singleton class it is not required. Hope, you will be clear after the following example.       public sealed class SingletonEmployeeService     {         // singleton static object         private static SingletonEmployeeService instance;          // an object to use in a singleton class         private List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = null;          // Restrict to create object of singleton class         private SingletonEmployeeService()         {             if(employees == null)             {                 employees = new List&lt;Employee&gt;();             }         }          // The static method to provide global access to the singleton object         // Get singleton object of SingletonEmployeeService class         public static SingletonEmployeeService GetInstance()         {             if (instance == null)             {                 // Thread safe singleton                 lock (typeof(SingletonEmployeeService))                 {                     instance = new SingletonEmployeeService();                 }             }             return instance;         }          // Add employee to the employees list         public void AddEmployee(Employee employee)         {             employees.Add(employee);         }          // Get name of the employee by Id          public string GetEmployeeName(int id) {                      string name = employees.Where(p =&gt; p.Id == id).First().Name;             return name;         }      }   Here’s how the code works:      The class is marked as “sealed”, which means it cannot be inherited.   The class has a private static object named “instance”, which holds the reference to the single instance of the class.   The class also has a private List of Employee objects, which is the actual data that this class is managing.   The constructor of the class is marked as private, which means that it can only be called from within the class itself. This ensures that no other code can create an instance of the class.   The only way to access the singleton instance of the class is through the public static method named “GetInstance()”, which checks whether the instance has been created already. If not, it creates a new instance of the class in a thread-safe manner using a lock statement.   lock() is used to create instance of the singleton pattern in thread safe manner in multi threaded environment.   The class has two public methods, “AddEmployee()” and “GetEmployeeName()”, which can be used to add an employee to the employees list and to get the name of an employee by their ID, respectively.   Step 3: Access the singleton class   This class creates an instance of singleton class by EmployeeService objEmployeeService = EmployeeService.Instance(); and access singleton class.       public class Program     {         static void Main(string[] args)         {              Employee emp1 = new Employee { Id = 1, Name = \"John\", Age = 30 };             Employee emp2 = new Employee { Id = 2, Name = \"Abraham\", Age = 40};                           // Create singleton instance using GetInstance method not new             SingletonEmployeeService singletonEmployeeService = SingletonEmployeeService.GetInstance();                          singletonEmployeeService.AddEmployee(emp1);             singletonEmployeeService.AddEmployee(emp2);              Console.WriteLine(singletonEmployeeService.GetEmployeeName(2));              Console.ReadKey();         }     }      // Output:     // Abraham    This C# code shows an example of how to use the SingletonEmployeeService class to manage employee data. The main() method creates two Employee objects and adds them to the singleton instance of the SingletonEmployeeService class using the AddEmployee() method. It then retrieves the name of the employee with ID=2 using the GetEmployeeName() method and prints it to the console.   The key thing to note here is that the SingletonEmployeeService class is accessed using the GetInstance() method, rather than creating a new instance using the “new” keyword. This ensures that there is only one instance of the SingletonEmployeeService class in the application and that it is globally accessible.   The code creates two Employee objects with different ID, Name, and Age values and adds them to the employees list of the singleton instance using the AddEmployee() method. Then, it retrieves the name of the employee with ID=2 using the GetEmployeeName() method, which returns the name of the employee as “Abraham” and prints it to the console using the Console.WriteLine() method.   Overall, this code demonstrates how the Singleton pattern can be used to ensure that there is only one instance of a class in the application and how this instance can be accessed globally to manage data in a centralized manner.

        "title": "Setup your own docker private registry in windows machine",
        "excerpt":"A Docker private registry is a centralized repository for storing and managing Docker images in a private and secure environment. Docker images are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that contain all the necessary components to run a software application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Instead of relying on public Docker Hub repositories, a private registry allows organizations to host their own Docker images internally.   Key features and benefits of a Docker private registry include:           Security: Keep sensitive or proprietary Docker images within the organization’s network, preventing unauthorized access.            Control: Maintain control over the distribution and versioning of Docker images, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.            Performance: Reduce image pull times by hosting images locally, especially beneficial in environments with limited or intermittent internet connectivity.            Customization: Tailor the registry to specific organizational requirements, adding authentication, access controls, and other features as needed.            Compliance: Adhere to data protection and regulatory requirements by managing and securing Docker images internally.       Required Tools and Technologies     Docker desktop   Docker Registry   Docker Registry front end   How to setup docker private registry           Install docker desktop in your windows machine. You can download it from here            Pull registry and, docker-registry-frontend images and then run in a container. You can pull images and run images in a container using separate command. But here I use a docker compose file to run both images in the container using a single command.       Here, registry image is used for storing and distributing of container images and artifacts and docker-registry-frontend is used as a frontend for the private registry.   docker-compose.yaml  # Version of the Docker Compose file version: \"3.7\"  # Definition of services in the Docker Compose file services:    # Service for the Docker Registry host   docker-registry-host:     # Docker image to be used for the service     image: registry          # Port mapping - maps port 5000 on the host to port 5000 on the container     ports:       - 5000:5000          # Volume mapping - mounts the local ./registry-data directory to /var/lib/registry in the container     volumes:       - ./registry-data:/var/lib/registry          # Network configuration - connects the service to the 'docker-registry' network     networks:       - docker-registry    # Service for the Docker Registry web UI   docker-registry-host-web-ui:     # Docker image to be used for the service     image: konradkleine/docker-registry-frontend:v2          # Environment variables for the service     environment:       ENV_DOCKER_REGISTRY_HOST: docker-registry-host       ENV_DOCKER_REGISTRY_PORT: 5000          # Port mapping - maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 on the container     ports:       - 8088:80          # Network configuration - connects the service to the 'docker-registry' network     networks:       - docker-registry  # Definition of a custom network named 'docker-registry' networks:   docker-registry:       Now open windows terminal and go the directory where docker-compose.yaml file resides and run the following command.   docker-compose up      Now you can access the docker registry frontend using the following url and you will see the following output.   http://localhost:8088/home      Create a sample ASP.NET Core application and push images to the private registry           Create a sample ASP.NET Core Web API application name - PrivateRegistryDemo            To see swagger in the release mode just comment out the following code in Program.cs file.            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.      //if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())      //{          app.UseSwagger();          app.UseSwaggerUI();      //}       Add a docker file in the project and add following contents   #See https://aka.ms/customizecontainer to learn how to customize your debug container and how Visual Studio uses this Dockerfile to build your images for faster debugging.

        "title": "Implementing Audit Trail in an ASP.NET Core Application with Entity Framework Plus",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   An audit trail is a chronological record of changes or activities performed in a system, providing a detailed history of events. In the context of software applications, including ASP.NET, an audit trail captures and logs various actions such as data modifications, user interactions, and system activities.   Why it is important? It helps organizations maintain a record of user activity within their systems, which can be used      To monitor user actions and detect suspicious activities   To track changes and identify the root cause of issues   To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements   Records changes to critical data elements, ensuring accuracy and consistency   Provides a detailed history of events for forensic analysis   Meets legal and regulatory requirements by maintaining a detailed audit trail   Offers historical data for reporting and analysis, supporting decision-making   Frud detection etc.   In this article, we will discuss how you can implement an audit trail feature using Entity Framework plus   Tools and Technology Used      ASP.net core Web API   Visual C#   Entity Framework Plus   Entity Framework   SQL Server   Step 1: Create a asp.net core web api project name AuditLog.API   Step 2: Install the following nuget packages in the project.   Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore Z.EntityFramework.Plus.EFCore Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools    Step 3: Create three Model class name Customer, CustomAuditEntry, CustomAuditEntryProperty in Models folder.      Customer class to store Customer Information   CustomAuditEntry class to store Audit Entry Information   CustomAuditEntryProperty class to store Audit Entry Property Information - means each properties new and old values   Customer.cs     namespace AuditLog.API.Models {     public class Customer     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string? FirstName { get; set; }         public string? LastName { get; set; }     } }    CustomAuditEntry.cs   using Z.EntityFramework.Plus;  namespace AuditLog.API.Models {     // CustomAuditEntry is a custom class that inherits from AuditEntry     // It is used to add additional properties to the AuditEntry class     public class CustomAuditEntry : AuditEntry     {         // ApplicationName is a custom property that will be added to the AuditEntry table for storing the application name         public string AppplicationName { get; set; }     } }    CustomAuditEntryProperty.cs   using Z.EntityFramework.Plus;  namespace AuditLog.API.Models {     public class CustomAuditEntryProperty : AuditEntryProperty     {         // ApplicationName is a custom property that will be added to the AuditEntryProperty table         // for storing the application name         public string AppplicationName { get; set; }     } }    Step 4: Create a Context class name AuditLogDBContext in Persistence folder.

Program.cs    using AuditLog.API.Models; using AuditLog.API.Persistence; using AuditLog.API.Repositories.Implementations; using AuditLog.API.Repositories.Interfaces; using AuditLog.API.Services.Implementations; using AuditLog.API.Services.Interfaces; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using Z.EntityFramework.Plus;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container.  builder.Services.AddControllers(); // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();   builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;AuditLogDBContext&gt;(options =&gt;     options.UseSqlServer(         builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\")) );   // For Audit Log  AuditManager.DefaultConfiguration .AuditEntryFactory = args =&gt;    new CustomAuditEntry() { AppplicationName = \"AuditLogApp\" };  AuditManager.DefaultConfiguration             .AuditEntryPropertyFactory = args =&gt;                 new CustomAuditEntryProperty() { AppplicationName = \"AuditLogApp\" };  AuditManager.DefaultConfiguration.AutoSavePreAction = (context, audit) =&gt; {     ((AuditLogDBContext)context).AuditEntries.AddRange(audit.Entries.Cast&lt;CustomAuditEntry&gt;()); };   string connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\"); //builder.Services.AddTransient(_ =&gt; new DBConnector(connectionString));  builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;ICustomerRepository, CustomerRepository&gt;(); builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;ICustomerService, CustomerService&gt;(); builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;IReportingRepositry, ReportingRepository&gt;(); builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;IReportingService, ReportingService&gt;();   var app = builder.Build();  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     app.UseSwagger();     app.UseSwaggerUI(); }  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  app.Run();     Step 11: Create two Controller class CustomersController and ReportingController in Controllers folder.   CustomersController.cs    using AuditLog.API.Models; using AuditLog.API.Services.Interfaces; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace AuditLog.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class CustomersController : ControllerBase     {         private readonly ICustomerService _customerService;          public CustomersController(ICustomerService customerService)         {             _customerService = customerService;         }          // GET: api/Customers         [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Customer&gt;&gt; GetCustomers()         {             return await _customerService.GetCustomers();         }          // GET: api/Customers/5         [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomer(int id)         {             return await _customerService.GetCustomer(id);         }          // PUT: api/Customers/5         [HttpPut(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;Customer?&gt; PutCustomer(int id, Customer customer)         {             if (id != customer.Id)             {                return null;             }             try             {                 return await _customerService.UpdateCustomer(customer);             }             catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)             {                 if (!CustomerExists(id))                 {                     return null;                 }                 else                 {                     throw;                 }             }         }          // POST: api/Customers         [HttpPost]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Customer&gt;&gt; PostCustomer(Customer customer)         {             return await _customerService.AddCustomer(customer);         }          // DELETE: api/Customers/5         [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;Customer&gt; DeleteCustomer(int id)         {             return await _customerService.DeleteCustomer(id);         }          private bool CustomerExists(int id)         {             return _customerService.GetCustomer(id) == null ? false : true;         }     } }     ReportingController.cs   using AuditLog.API.Services.Interfaces; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;  namespace AuditLog.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class ReportingController : ControllerBase     {         private readonly IReportingService _reportingService;          public ReportingController(IReportingService reportingService)         {             _reportingService = reportingService;         }          // GET: api/AuditTrailReport         [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Index()         {             return NoContent();         }          // GET: api/AuditTrailReport/{EntityName}         [HttpGet(\"GetChangeLog/{EntityName}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetChangeLog(string EntityName)         {             return Ok(await _reportingService.GetChangeLogDynamic(EntityName));         }     } }   Step 12: Create migration and update database     Open Package Manager Console (PMC).   Select the project name AuditLog.API   Run the following command in PMC   Add-Migration InitialCreate  This will create a new migration file named “InitialCreate” under the Migrations folder of your      Run the following command in PMC   Update-Database      You will see three table name Customers, AuditEntry, AuditEntryProperty are created in the database   Step 13: Run the application and check the swagger.     Now run application create, update and delete Customer entity using swagger   You will see audit trail logs in AuditEntry and AuditEntryProperty table.   You can also view a sample report using Reporting controller. In GetChangeLog end point use “Customer” as entity name.    Source code  ","categories": ["ASP.NET","ASP.NET Core","C#","Web API","EF"],

        "title": "Simplified Sample Application: Building with Redux Toolkit, React.js, and ASP.NET Core",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   Redux is a popular state management library for JavaScript applications. It is commonly used with front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, but can also be used with other frameworks or even vanilla JavaScript. At its core, Redux provides a predictable state container for managing the state of an application. It helps you manage the data that needs to be shared across different components in a more organized and efficient way. The main concept behind Redux is that the entire state of an application is stored in a single JavaScript object, known as the “store.” The Redux store is immutable, which means that you cannot directly modify the state. Instead, to make changes to the state, you dispatch actions. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what should change in the state. These actions are processed by pure functions called “reducers,” which take the current state and the dispatched action and return a new state. The unidirectional data flow in Redux ensures that the state changes are predictable and easy to debug, as every state mutation is explicitly defined by actions and reducers.   Redux Toolkit   Redux Toolkit is an official package from the Redux team that simplifies and streamlines the process of working with Redux. It provides a set of utilities and best practices to make Redux development more efficient, maintainable, and less boilerplate-heavy. Before Redux Toolkit, working with Redux required writing a significant amount of code to set up the store, define actions, and write reducers. Redux Toolkit abstracts away much of this boilerplate code and provides a more intuitive and standardized way of using Redux.   Key features of Redux Toolkit include:      Configuration Simplicity: Redux Toolkit provides a function called configureStore that creates a Redux store with default configurations. It includes sensible defaults for setting up the store, applying middleware, and enabling Redux DevTools for debugging.   Reduces Boilerplate: With Redux Toolkit, you can define “slice” reducers using the createSlice function. A slice is a single part of the Redux store that includes both the reducer and its related actions. This reduces the need to write separate action creators and action types manually.   Immutability and Immer Integration: Redux Toolkit leverages the immer library to handle state immutability in a more convenient way. This allows you to write reducers that look like they are directly mutating the state while Redux Toolkit takes care of creating a new immutable state behind the scenes.   Thunk Simplification: Redux Toolkit provides the createAsyncThunk function to simplify the creation of thunks for handling asynchronous actions. It makes it easier to write async logic, such as API calls, by dispatching pending, fulfilled, and rejected actions automatically.   Easy Migration: If you already have an existing Redux application, Redux Toolkit provides a smooth migration path. It offers compatibility with standard Redux code, allowing you to gradually transition your codebase to the new approach.   Objective:  In this article I will show you how to build a front-end application using redux toolkit with react and asp.net core. Here I am going to create a backend application and a front-end application. Backend application is simple asp.net core application which exposes API. Front end application consumes the api, perform CRUD operation and manage state using redux toolkit. Let’s start.   Tools and Technology Used      ASP.net core Web API   Visual C#   React.js   Redux Toolkit   Axios   Bootstrap   react-toastify   Step 1: Create a asp.net core web api project name Ecommerce.API   Step 2: Install the following nuget packages in the project.   Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design   Step 3: Create two Model class name Product and Customer in Models folder.   Product.cs   namespace ECommerce.API.Models {     public class Product     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string? Name { get; set; }         public string? Description { get; set; }         public decimal Price { get; set; }         public int StockQuantity { get; set; }     } }    Customer.cs    namespace ECommerce.API.Models {     public class Customer     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string? FirstName { get; set; }         public string? LastName { get; set; }         public string? Email { get; set; }         public string? Phone { get; set; }         public DateTime BirthDate { get; set; }      } }     Step 4: Create a Context class name ECommerceContext for data access in Db folder.   ECommerceContext.cs   using ECommerce.API.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace ECommerce.API.Db { public class ECommerceContext : DbContext { public ECommerceContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ECommerceContext&gt; options) : base(options) {          }         public DbSet&lt;Product&gt; Products { get;set; }         public DbSet&lt;Customer&gt; Customers { get; set; }     }  }    Step 5: Create a Seed Generator class name SeedGenerator in Db folder.   SeedGenerator.cs   using ECommerce.API.Models;  namespace ECommerce.API.Db {     public class SeedGenerator     {         public static void SeedData(WebApplication app)         {             using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())             {                 var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetService&lt;ECommerceContext&gt;();                   if (!context.Products.Any())                 {                      context.Products.AddRange(                         new Product                         {                             Name = \"Smartphone\",                             Description = \"A powerful and sleek smartphone with advanced features.\",                             Price = 699.99m,                             StockQuantity = 50                         },                         new Product                         {                             Name = \"Laptop\",                             Description = \"A high-performance laptop for both work and entertainment.\",                             Price = 1299.99m,                             StockQuantity = 25                         },                         new Product                         {                             Name = \"Wireless Earbuds\",                             Description = \"Premium wireless earbuds with noise-canceling technology.\",                             Price = 149.99m,                             StockQuantity = 100                         },                         new Product                         {                             Name = \"Smart Watch\",                             Description = \"A stylish smartwatch with fitness tracking and app notifications.\",                             Price = 199.99m,                             StockQuantity = 30                         });                 }                   if (!context.Customers.Any())                 {                     context.Customers.AddRange(                         new Customer                         {                             Id = 1,                             FirstName = \"John\",                             LastName = \"Doe\",                             Email = \"john@example.com\",                             Phone = \"555-1234\",                             BirthDate = new DateTime(1990, 5, 15)                         },                         new Customer                         {                             Id = 2,                             FirstName = \"Jane\",                             LastName = \"Smith\",                             Email = \"jane@example.com\",                             Phone = \"555-5678\",                             BirthDate = new DateTime(1985, 8, 22)                         },                         new Customer                         {                             Id = 3,                             FirstName = \"Michael\",                             LastName = \"Johnson\",                             Email = \"michael@example.com\",                             Phone = \"555-9876\",                             BirthDate = new DateTime(1992, 10, 10)                         });                 }                     context.SaveChanges();              }         }     } }     Step 6: Configure Program class as follows.   Program.cs    using ECommerce.API.Db; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container.  builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;ECommerceContext&gt;(opt =&gt; opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"ECommerceDB\"));  builder.Services.AddControllers(); // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();  var app = builder.Build();  //For seeding data SeedGenerator.SeedData(app);  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     app.UseSwagger();     app.UseSwaggerUI();      // Enable CORS     app.UseCors(x =&gt; x     .AllowAnyMethod()     .AllowAnyHeader()     .SetIsOriginAllowed(origin =&gt; true) // allow any origin     .AllowCredentials()); // allow credentials }  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  app.Run();    Step 7: Create two Controller class name ProductsController and CustomersController in Controllers folder.   ProductsController.cs   using ECommerce.API.Db; using ECommerce.API.Models; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace ECommerce.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase     {         private readonly ECommerceContext _context;

e.Id == id)).GetValueOrDefault();         }     } }    Now our back-end application is ready. You can run and check the application using swagger.   Step 8: Create a react application name - redux-app. Run the following command in your power shell terminal.   npx create-react-app redux-app   Step 9: Install the following packages in the react project   npm install bootstrap@4.6.0 npm install react-router-dom npm install react-toastify npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit npm install axios   Step 10: Create Conversion.js file in src-&gt;utils folder.   Conversion.js   export const convertDateFormat = (date) =&gt; {   let convertedDate = new Date(date);   return convertedDate.toDateString(); };  export const ConvertDateISOString = (date) =&gt; {   return new Date(date).toISOString().slice(0, 10); };   Step 11: Create ToastifyMessage.js file in src-&gt;helper folder.   ToastifyMessage.js   import { toast } from \"react-toastify\";  export const SuccessToastify = (message) =&gt; {   toast.success(message, {     position: toast.POSITION.TOP_CENTER,     autoClose: 3000, // auto close after 30 seconds   }); };  export const WarningTostify = (message) =&gt; {   toast.warning(message, {     position: toast.POSITION.TOP_RIGHT,     autoClose: 3000, // auto close after 30 seconds   }); };  export const ErrorToastify = (message) =&gt; {   toast.error(message, {     position: toast.POSITION.TOP_RIGHT,     autoClose: 3000, // auto close after 30 seconds   }); };  export const InfoToastify = (message) =&gt; {   toast.info(message, {     position: toast.POSITION.TOP_RIGHT,     autoClose: 3000, // auto close after 30 seconds   }); };   Step 12: Configure Http connection using axios      Create BaseURL.js in src-&gt;config folder to set the base URL for API   BaseURL.js   export const Base_URL = \"https://localhost:7288/api\";      Create http-common.js in src-&gt;config folder  http-common.js   import axios from \"axios\"; import { Base_URL } from \"./BaseURL\";  export default axios.create({   baseURL: Base_URL,   headers: {     \"Content-type\": \"application/json\",   }, });   Step 13: Create Service Components      Create ProductService.js in src-&gt;services folder.   ProductService.js   //ProductDataService to make asynchronous HTTP requests import http from \"../config/http-common\";  const getAll = () =&gt; {   return http.get(\"/Products\"); };  const get = (id) =&gt; {   return http.get(`/Products/${id}`); };  const create = (data) =&gt; {   return http.post(\"/Products\", data); };  const update = (id, data) =&gt; {   return http.put(`/Products/${id}`, data); };  const remove = (id) =&gt; {   return http.delete(`/Products/${id}`); }; const ProductDataService = {   getAll,   get,   create,   update,   remove, };  export default ProductDataService;      Create CustomerService.js in src-&gt;services folder.   CustomerService.js   //CustomerDataService to make asynchronous HTTP requests import http from \"../config/http-common\";  const getAll = () =&gt; {   return http.get(\"/Customers\"); };  const get = (id) =&gt; {   return http.get(`/Customers/${id}`); };  const create = (data) =&gt; {   return http.post(\"/Customers\", data); };  const update = (id, data) =&gt; {   return http.put(`/Customers/${id}`, data); };  const remove = (id) =&gt; {   return http.delete(`/Customers/${id}`); };  const findByName = (name) =&gt; {   return http.get(`/Customers/SearchCustomers?name=${name}`); };  const CustomerDataService = {   getAll,   get,   create,   update,   remove,   findByName, };  export default CustomerDataService;   Step 14: Configure Redux      Create Slice, Reducer and Actions : Instead of creating many folders and files for Redux (actions, reducers, types,…), with redux-toolkit we just need all-in-one: slice. A slice is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature.   To create a slice, you only need to define the following:      A name to identify the slice.   The initial state value.   One or more reducer functions to specify how the state can be updated.   Once you’ve created a slice, you can effortlessly export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the entire slice. Redux Toolkit simplifies this process with the createSlice() function, which automatically generates action types and action creators based on the reducer function names you provide.      Create slice for Product state. Create productsSlice.js in src-&gt;redux-&gt;slice folder.   productsSlice.js   import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\"; import ProductDataService from \"../../services/ProductService\";  const initialState = [];  export const createProduct = createAsyncThunk(   \"products/create\",   async (inputData) =&gt; {     const res = await ProductDataService.create(inputData);     return res.data;   } );  export const retrieveProducts = createAsyncThunk(   \"products/retrieve\",   async () =&gt; {     const res = await ProductDataService.getAll();     return res.data;   } );  export const updateProduct = createAsyncThunk(   \"products/update\",   async ({ id, data }) =&gt; {     debugger;     const res = await ProductDataService.update(id, data);     return res.data;   } );  export const deleteProduct = createAsyncThunk(\"products/delete\", async (id) =&gt; {   debugger;   await ProductDataService.remove(id);   return { id }; });  const productSlice = createSlice({   name: \"product\",   initialState,   extraReducers: {     [createProduct.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       state.push(action.payload);     },      [retrieveProducts.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       return [...action.payload];     },      [updateProduct.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       const index = state.findIndex(         (tutorial) =&gt; tutorial.id === action.payload.id       );       state[index] = {         ...state[index],         ...action.payload,       };     },      [deleteProduct.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       let index = state.findIndex(({ id }) =&gt; id === action.payload.id);       state.splice(index, 1);     },   }, });  const { reducer } = productSlice; export default reducer;      Create slice for Customer state. Create customersSlice.js in src-&gt;redux-&gt;slice folder.   customersSlice.js   import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\"; import CustomerDataService from \"../../services/CustomerService\";  const initialState = [];  export const createCustomer = createAsyncThunk(   \"customers/create\",   async (inputData) =&gt; {     const response = await CustomerDataService.create(inputData);     return response.data;   } );  export const retrieveCustomers = createAsyncThunk(   \"customers/retrieve\",   async () =&gt; {     debugger;     const res = await CustomerDataService.getAll();     return res.data;   } );  export const updateCustomer = createAsyncThunk(   \"customers/update\",   async ({ id, data }) =&gt; {     const res = await CustomerDataService.update(id, data);     return res.data;   } );  export const deleteCustomer = createAsyncThunk(   \"customers/delete\",   async (id) =&gt; {     await CustomerDataService.remove(id);     return { id };   } );  export const deleteAllCustomer = createAsyncThunk(   \"customers/deleteAll\",   async () =&gt; {     const res = await CustomerDataService.removeAll();     return res.data;   } );  export const findCustomerByName = createAsyncThunk(   \"customers/findByName\",   async ({ name }) =&gt; {     name = name === null || name === \"\" ? \"all\" : name;     const res = await CustomerDataService.findByName(name);     return res.data;   } );  const customerSlice = createSlice({   name: \"customer\",   initialState,   extraReducers: {     [createCustomer.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       state.push(action.payload);     },      [retrieveCustomers.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       return [...action.payload];     },      [updateCustomer.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       const index = state.findIndex(         (tutorial) =&gt; tutorial.id === action.payload.id       );       state[index] = {         ...state[index],         ...action.payload,       };     },      [deleteCustomer.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       let index = state.findIndex(({ id }) =&gt; id === action.payload.id);       state.splice(index, 1);     },     [deleteAllCustomer.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       return [];     },     [findCustomerByName.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {       return [...action.payload];     },   }, });  // destructure reducer from customerSlice // name mustbe reducer const { reducer } = customerSlice; export default reducer;      Create Redux Store in src-&gt;redux folder name store.js   Store.js   // This Store will bring Actions and Reducers together and hold the Application state.  import { configureStore } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\"; import productReducer from \"./slices/productsSlice\"; import customerReducer from \"./slices/customersSlice\";  const reducer = {   products: productReducer,   customers: customerReducer, };  const store = configureStore({   reducer: reducer,   devTools: true, });  export default store;   Note:  The Store is the central entity that combines Actions and Reducers, responsible for managing the entire application state.   With the help of the configureStore() function from Redux Toolkit, you can enjoy the following automated benefits:      It enables the Redux DevTools Extension out of the box, providing powerful debugging capabilities.   The thunk middleware is automatically set up, allowing you to start writing thunks without any additional configuration.   Step 15: Make state available to React components.      Modify the index.js as follows. Here, we are wrapping the entire application in a  component to make store available to its child components.   Index.js   import \"react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css\"; import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; import \"./index.css\"; import App from \"./App\"; import reportWebVitals from \"./reportWebVitals\"; import { Provider } from \"react-redux\"; import store from \"./redux/store\";  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")); root.render(   &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;     {/* Now we want our entire React App to access the store */}     &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;       &lt;App /&gt;     &lt;/Provider&gt;   &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt; );  // If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function // to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log)) // or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals reportWebVitals();   Step 16: Create a Component for Nav bar name TopNav.js in src-&gt;layout folder.   TopNav.js   import React from \"react\"; import { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";  const TopNav = () =&gt; {   return (     &lt;nav className=\"navbar navbar-expand navbar-dark bg-dark\"&gt;       &lt;a href=\"/products\" className=\"navbar-brand\"&gt;         Mahedee.net       &lt;/a&gt;       &lt;div className=\"navbar-nav mr-auto\"&gt;         &lt;li className=\"nav-item\"&gt;           &lt;Link to={\"/products\"} className=\"nav-link\"&gt;             Products           &lt;/Link&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;          &lt;li className=\"nav-item\"&gt;           &lt;Link to={\"/customers\"} className=\"nav-link\"&gt;             Customers           &lt;/Link&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/nav&gt;   ); };  export default TopNav;   Step 17: Create components for CRUD operation for Product in src-&gt;components-&gt;product.

        "excerpt":"Introduction  Micro frontends are an architectural pattern and approach for building modern web applications. Similar to microservices on the backend, micro frontends focus on breaking down the user interface (UI) into smaller, self-contained, and independently deployable parts.   In traditional monolithic frontend architectures, the entire UI is developed as a single codebase, making it difficult to scale, maintain, and iterate on different parts of the application independently. Micro frontends aim to address these challenges by allowing teams to develop and deploy UI components or features as separate entities.   Each micro frontend typically represents a distinct business capability or user journey and can be developed using different technologies or frameworks. This enables teams to choose the most suitable technology stack for their specific needs. For example, one micro frontend may be built using React, while another may use Angular or Vue.js.   Micro frontends communicate with each other and the backend through well-defined APIs or events, enabling them to work together seamlessly as a cohesive application. This approach promotes modularization, scalability, and reusability, as teams can develop, test, and deploy their micro frontends independently.   By adopting micro frontends, organizations can effectively distribute development efforts among multiple teams, enabling faster delivery, easier maintenance, and better isolation of components. This approach also facilitates technology diversity, allowing teams to leverage different tools and frameworks within the same application.      Fig: Micro frontend Architecture. (Source: Internet)   Objective  In this article I will show you how to build Micro front end application using react and asp.net core. Here I am going to create four react applications. One is Master or Container service and other three will be child project or service. Master service will be master-frontend application and other three service will be header-frontend, product-frontend and customer-frontend. I will create two api project using asp.net core for product-frontend and customer-frontend. At the end you will see a complete micro frontend application up and running.   Step 1: Create four react projects.      Open a terminal or bash, write below commands to create four React projects.   npx create-react-app master-frontend npx create-react-app header-frontend npx create-react-app product-frontend npx create-react-app customer-frontend   Step 2: Configure “header-frontend” react project      Now we are going to configure header-frontend project to use inside our Master Project as a service.   Go to header-frontend project   Open the terminal and install below libraries with below command.     npm install react-router-dom npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3 npm install react-app-rewired history           Inside the src directory, create a folder and name the folder components.   Inside components folder create a file and name the file Header.js   Write below code in src-&gt;components-&gt;Header.js   import React from \"react\"; import { Container } from \"react-bootstrap\";  const Header = () =&gt; {   return (     &lt;Container fluid className=\"App-header\"&gt;       &lt;p&gt;Micro Frontend using React.js&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/Container&gt;   ); };  export default Header;      Open App.js file and replace with below code.   import logo from \"./logo.svg\"; import \"./App.css\"; import { BrowserRouter } from \"react-router-dom\"; import Header from \"./components/Header\";  function App() {   return (     &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;       &lt;Header /&gt;     &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;   ); }  export default App;      Open App.css file and replace the file with below code.   .App-header {   background-color: #4d739e;   min-height: 3vh;   display: flex;   flex-direction: column;   align-items: center;   justify-content: center;   font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);   color: white;    box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25) 0px 5px 15px; }      Create another file inside src folder, name the file setupProxy.js and write below code for cors policy.   module.exports = (app) =&gt; {   app.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {     res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");     next();   }); };      Open index.js file and replace with below code.   import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; import \"./index.css\"; import \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\"; import App from \"./App\"; import reportWebVitals from \"./reportWebVitals\";  window.renderHeader = (masterId, history) =&gt; {   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(masterId));    root.render(     &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;       &lt;App history={history} /&gt;     &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;   ); };  window.unmountHeader = (masterId) =&gt; {   ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(document.getElementById(masterId)); };  if (!document.getElementById(\"Header-master\")) {   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));   root.render(     &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;       &lt;App /&gt;     &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;   ); }  // If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function // to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log)) // or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals reportWebVitals();      Create a file inside root directory and name the file config-overrides.js and write below code. Below code will override webpack of react.   module.exports = {   webpack: (config, env) =&gt; {     config.optimization.runtimeChunk = false;     config.optimization.splitChunks = {       cacheGroups: {         default: false,       },     };      config.output.filename = \"static/js/[name].js\";      config.plugins[5].options.filename = \"static/css/[name].css\";     config.plugins[5].options.moduleFilename = () =&gt; \"static/css/main.css\";     return config;   }, };      Open package.json and replace “scripts” section with below code. This project going to be open on 3001 port because we set PORT = 3001 in script section.   \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"set PORT=3001 &amp;&amp; react-app-rewired start\", \"build\": \"react-app-rewired build\", \"test\": \"react-app-rewired test\", \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\" },       Now open the terminal and start the project with below command.   npm start      Browser output should look like below. If you see below output, means our header frontend project is ready.      Step 3: Create Product.API Backend Project      Create a web api project name Product.API   Install following Nuget packages in the project   Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design       Create following two model class in Model folder   Product.cs   namespace Product.API.Model {     public class Product     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string? Name { get; set; }         public string? ShortName { get; set;}         public double Price { get; set; }         public DateTime? ManufactureDate { get; set; }         public DateTime? ExpiryDate { get; set; }     } }    Category.cs   namespace Product.API.Model {     public class Category     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string? Name { get; set; }         public string? DisplayName { get; set;}     } }       Add following DbContext and SeedGenerator class in Db folder   ProductContext.cs   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using Product.API.Model;  namespace Product.API.Db { public class ProductContext : DbContext { public ProductContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ProductContext&gt; options) : base(options) {          }         public DbSet&lt;Product.API.Model.Product&gt; Products { get; set; }         public DbSet&lt;Category&gt; Categories { get; set; }     }  }    SeedGenerator.cs   using Product.API.Model;  namespace Product.API.Db {     public class SeedGenerator     {         public static void SeedData(WebApplication app)         {             using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())             {                 var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetService&lt;ProductContext&gt;();                 if (!context.Products.Any())                 {                     context.Products.AddRange(                         new Product.API.Model.Product                         {                             Name = \"Cat's Shirt \",                             ShortName = \"Shirt\",                             Price = 1200,                             ManufactureDate = DateTime.Today,                             ExpiryDate = DateTime.Now.AddYears(5)                         },                          new Product.API.Model.Product                          {                              Name = \"Lipton Tea Bag\",                              ShortName = \"Tea\",                              Price = 150,                              ManufactureDate = DateTime.Today,                              ExpiryDate = DateTime.Now.AddYears(2)                          }                          );                     context.SaveChanges();                 }                  if (!context.Categories.Any())                 {                     context.Categories.AddRange(                         new Category                         {                             Name = \"Beverages\",                             DisplayName = \"Beverages\"                         },                         new Category                         {                             Name = \"Grossery\",                             DisplayName = \"Grossery\"                         });                     context.SaveChanges();                 }               }         }     } }       Modify Program.cs file to configure in memory database and seed data as follows.   Program.cs   //using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using Product.API.Db;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container. builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;ProductContext&gt;(opt =&gt; opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"ProductDB\"));  builder.Services.AddControllers();  // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();

 app.UseAuthorization();  app.UseRouting(); app.MapControllers();  app.Run();       Create two controller class name ProductsController and CategoriesController in Controllers folder   ProductsController.cs   using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using Product.API.Db;  namespace Product.API.Controllers { [Route(\"api/[controller]\")] [ApiController] public class ProductsController : ControllerBase { private readonly ProductContext \\_context;

Step 4: Configure product-frontend React Project   Now we are going to configure product-frontend project to use inside our Master Project as a service.      Open the Terminal and install below libraries with below command.   npm install react-router-dom npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3 npm install react-app-rewired npm install axios history npm install react-data-table-component npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components npm install @mui/icons-material       Inside the src directory, create a folder and name the folder utils.   Inside utils folder create a file and name the file BaseUrl.js   Write below code because our product api is running on 7155 port   BaseUrl.js   export const Base_URL_Product = \"https://localhost:7155/api\";      Create another js file inside the utils directory and name the file Conversions.js, write below code.   Conversions.js   export const convertDateFormat = (date) =&gt; {   let convertedDate = new Date(date);   return convertedDate.toDateString(); };      Inside the src directory, create a folder and name the folder services.   Inside services folder create a file and name the file ProductService.js   Write below code in src-&gt;services-&gt; ProductService.js   ProductService.js   import axios from \"axios\"; import { Base_URL_Product } from \"../utils/BaseUrl\";  export const GetAllProducts = () =&gt; {   try {     const response = axios.get(Base_URL_Product + `/Products`);     console.log(\"response\", response);     return response;   } catch (er) {     throw er;   } };  export const GetAllCategory = () =&gt; {   try {     const response = axios.get(Base_URL_Product + `/Categories`);     return response;   } catch (er) {     throw er;   } };      Inside the src directory, create a folder and name the folder components.

        "title": "Exploring Concurrency and Concurrency Management in ASP.NET Core Applications with Entity Framework",
        "excerpt":"Concurrency refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes within a system. In the context of software development, it often involves managing multiple operations concurrently to improve system efficiency and responsiveness.   Handling concurrency in software applications is crucial to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency when multiple users or processes attempt to access and modify shared data simultaneously. Several techniques are employed to manage concurrency effectively:   Pessimistic Concurrency Control: Acquiring locks on data before allowing any modifications, ensuring exclusive access during the transaction.   Optimistic Concurrency Control: Allowing multiple transactions to proceed independently but checking for conflicts at the end, typically through versioning or timestamps, and handling conflicts accordingly.   Locking Mechanisms: Using locks to control access to shared resources and ensuring that only one process can modify data at a time.   Transaction Isolation: Employing transactional mechanisms to encapsulate a series of operations, ensuring they either all succeed or none at all, thus maintaining data integrity.   Conflict Resolution: Implementing strategies to resolve conflicts when they occur, such as merging changes, notifying users of conflicts, or rolling back transactions.   Understanding the nature of the application, the database system in use, and the specific concurrency requirements helps developers choose the most suitable approach for handling concurrency effectively. But, Optimistic Concurrency control mechanism is mostly used in the industry.   Optimistic concurrency handling using application managed token using entity framework  In this article, we will explore how to handle optimistic concurrency  using application managed token using entity framework. In this case, the client application will send the token to the server with the request. The server will check the token with the database. If the token is valid, then the server will update the data and send the updated token to the client. If the token is invalid, then the server will send the error message to the client. The client will show the error message to the user and refresh the data from the server. Let’s move to the demo on how to handle optimistic concurrency using an application-managed token.   Tools and Technology Used      ASP.net core Web API   Visual C#   Entity Framework   SQL Server   Step 1: Create a asp.net core web api project name ConcurrencyHandling.API   Step 2: Install the following nuget packages in the project.   Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools    Step 3: Create a Model class name Booking      Booking class to store Booking Information   In the following class RecordVersion property is a Guid which is used to track the updated version of the record.   ConcurrencyCheck attribute is specifies that this property participates in optimistic concurrency checking. This column is used in the WHERE clause of UPDATE and DELETE operation.   Booking.cs   using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;  namespace ConcurrencyHandling.API.Models {     public class Booking     {         public int BookingID { get; set; }         public string CustomerName { get; set; }         public int RoomID { get; set; }         public DateTime BookingDate { get; set; }         public DateTime CheckInDate { get; set; }         public DateTime CheckOutDate { get; set; }          // ConcurrencyCheck is specifies that this property participates in optimistic concurrency checking.         [ConcurrencyCheck]         public Guid RecordVersion { get; set; }     } }    Step 4: Create a Context class name ApplicationDbContext in Data folder.   ApplicationDbContext.cs   using ConcurrencyHandling.API.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace ConcurrencyHandling.API.Data {     public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext     {         public DbSet&lt;Booking&gt;?

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools    Step 3: Create a Model class name Product in Models folder      Product class to store Product Information   In the following class RecordVersion property is used to track the updated version of the record.   Account.cs   namespace ConcurrencyHandling.API.Models {     public class Product     {         public int ProductId { get; set; }         public string? Name { get; set; }         public decimal Price { get; set; }         public int StockQuantity { get; set; }          // Concurrency control properties         public Guid RecordVersion { get; set; }     } }    Step 4: Create a Context class name ApplicationDbContext in Data folder.   ApplicationDbContext.cs   using ConcurrencyHandling.API.Models; using ConcurrencyHandling.API.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace ConcurrencyHandling.API.Data {     public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext     {         public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt; options) : base(options)         {          }         public DbSet&lt;Product&gt;? Product { get; set; }      } }    Step 5: Add connection string in appsettings.json file   appsettings.json   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\"     }   }, \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=localhost;Database=ConcurrencyEtagsDB;User Id=sa;Password=MyPassword;TrustServerCertificate=True;\"   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\" }    Step 6: Configure Program class as follows.   Program.cs   using ConcurrencyHandling.API.Data; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container.  builder.Services.AddControllers(); // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();  builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();  builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;     options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\")));  var app = builder.Build();  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     app.UseSwagger();     app.UseSwaggerUI(); }  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  app.Run();    Step 7: Create a Controller class ProductsController in Controllers folder.     In GetProduct action Etag header is added with the response header like below.   Response.Headers.Add(ETAG_HEADER, product.RecordVersion.ToString());      In the PutProduct and DeleteProduct actions, if the existing record’s version matches the current Etag and the requested Etag, then the update and delete operations will occur; otherwise, they will not take place.   public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PutProduct(int id, Product product) {     if (id != product.ProductId)     {         return BadRequest();     }      var existingProduct = await _context.Product.FindAsync(id);     if (existingProduct == null)     {         return NotFound();     }      // Check ETag header     var existingProductETag = existingProduct.RecordVersion.ToString();     var requestProductETag = Request.Headers[IF_MATCH_HEADER].FirstOrDefault();      if (existingProductETag != requestProductETag)     {         // StatusCodes.Status412PreconditionFailed means \"Precondition Failed\"         // meaning the ETag header value does not match the current ETag value         return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status412PreconditionFailed);     }      // Update the existing product with the new values     _context.Entry(existingProduct).CurrentValues.SetValues(product);     existingProduct.RecordVersion = Guid.NewGuid();     _context.Entry(existingProduct).State = EntityState.Modified;      try     {          await _context.SaveChangesAsync();     }     catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)     {         throw;     }      return NoContent(); }   ProductsController.cs    using ConcurrencyHandling.API.Data; using ConcurrencyHandling.API.Models; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace ConcurrencyHandling.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]      // Concurrency check using ETags     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase     {         private const string ETAG_HEADER = \"ETag\";         private const string IF_MATCH_HEADER = \"If-Match\";          private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;          public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext context)         {             _context = context;         }          // GET: api/Products         [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt;&gt; GetProduct()         {           if (_context.Product == null)           {               return NotFound();           }             return await _context.Product.ToListAsync();         }          // GET: api/Products/5         [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt;

            }              // Add ETag header             Response.Headers.Add(ETAG_HEADER, product.RecordVersion.ToString());             return product;         }          // PUT: api/Products/5         // To protect from overposting attacks, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2123754         [HttpPut(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PutProduct(int id, Product product)         {             if (id != product.ProductId)             {                 return BadRequest();             }              var existingProduct = await _context.Product.FindAsync(id);             if (existingProduct == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              // Check ETag header             var existingProductETag = existingProduct.RecordVersion.ToString();             var requestProductETag = Request.Headers[IF_MATCH_HEADER].FirstOrDefault();              if (existingProductETag != requestProductETag)             {                 // StatusCodes.Status412PreconditionFailed means \"Precondition Failed\"                 // meaning the ETag header value does not match the current ETag value                 return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status412PreconditionFailed);             }              // Update the existing product with the new values             _context.Entry(existingProduct).CurrentValues.SetValues(product);             existingProduct.RecordVersion = Guid.NewGuid();             _context.Entry(existingProduct).State = EntityState.Modified;              try             {                  await _context.SaveChangesAsync();             }             catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)             {                 throw;             }              return NoContent();         }          // POST: api/Products         // To protect from overposting attacks, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2123754         [HttpPost]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; PostProduct(Product product)         {           if (_context.Product == null)           {               return Problem(\"Entity set 'ApplicationDbContext.Product'  is null.\");           }             product.RecordVersion = Guid.NewGuid();             _context.Product.Add(product);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              return CreatedAtAction(\"GetProduct\", new { id = product.ProductId }, product);         }          // DELETE: api/Products/5         [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt;

             if(product == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }              var existingProductETag = product.RecordVersion.ToString();             var requestProductETag = Request.Headers[IF_MATCH_HEADER].FirstOrDefault();              if (existingProductETag != requestProductETag)             {                 // StatusCodes.Status412PreconditionFailed means \"Precondition Failed\"                 // meaning the ETag header value does not match the current ETag value                 return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status412PreconditionFailed);

e.ProductId == id)).GetValueOrDefault();         //}     } }     Step 8: Create migration and update database     Open Package Manager Console (PMC).   Select the project name ConcurrencyHandling.API   Run the following command in PMC   Add-Migration InitialCreate  This will create a new migration file named “InitialCreate” under the Migrations folder of your      Run the following command in PMC   Update-Database   Step 9: Run the application and test concurrency      Create a new record by PostProduct action using swagger. Sample example for post data.   {   \"productId\": 0,   \"name\": \"Dell Laptop\",   \"price\": 1200,   \"stockQuantity\": 50 }      Now, let’s modify the record using the PUT method. Keep in mind to include the current ETag value in the If-Match request header.              Do same for the delete method.            You can only update and delete record only when if-match header is same as row version otherwise not.

Sample example for post data.   {   \"employeeID\": 0,   \"name\": \"Tahiya Hasan\",   \"salary\": 1000000 }      Now, let’s retrieve the record using the GET method. You will get the following response.   {   \"id\": 1,   \"name\": \"Tahiya Hasan\",   \"salary\": 1000000,   \"rowVersion\": \"8568375c-cfa5-4ec2-a2ab-b06184f424ad\",   \"links\": [     {       \"rel\": \"edit\",       \"href\": \"/employees/1/8568375c-cfa5-4ec2-a2ab-b06184f424ad\",       \"method\": \"PUT\"     },     {       \"rel\": \"delete\",       \"href\": \"/employees/1/8568375c-cfa5-4ec2-a2ab-b06184f424ad\",       \"method\": \"DELETE\"     }   ] }      Modify or delete the record by using either the provided URL or the specified version number within the URL. In the backend, the version number from the URL will be compared with the existing version number in the action method as outlined in the controller code. The action will only be executed if the version numbers from the URL and the existing record match.

        "excerpt":"Introduction The Audit Trail stands out as a critical feature in enterprise applications, primarily serving essential roles in security and fraud transaction detection. An audit trail is a chronological record of changes or activities performed in a system, providing a detailed history of events. In the context of software applications, including ASP.NET, an audit trail captures and logs various actions such as data modifications, user interactions, and system activities. This article delves into a comprehensive guide on implementing Audit Trail functionality in an ASP.NET Core application using SQL Server with ADO.NET.   Why it is important? It helps organizations maintain a record of user activity within their systems, which can be used      To monitor user actions and detect suspicious activities   To track changes and identify the root cause of issues   To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements   Records changes to critical data elements, ensuring accuracy and consistency   Provides a detailed history of events for forensic analysis   Meets legal and regulatory requirements by maintaining a detailed audit trail   Offers historical data for reporting and analysis, supporting decision-making   Frud detection etc.   In this article, we will discuss how you can implement an audit trail feature using Entity Framework plus   Tools and Technology Used     ASP.net core Web API   Visual C#   ADO.NET   SQL Server   Step 1: Create Database and related tables in MS SQL Server     Create a database name AuditLogDB   Create a table name Product to store Product information   Create a AuditEntry and AuditEntryProperty table to store audit information.   Product Table   CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Products]( \t[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, \t[Name] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL, \t[Price] [decimal](18, 2) NOT NULL, \t[Quantity] [int] NOT NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PK_Products] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  ( \t[Id] ASC )WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON, OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY] ) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY] GO   AuditEntry Table    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[AuditEntry]( \t[AuditEntryID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, \t[EntitySetName] [nvarchar](255) NULL, \t[EntityTypeName] [nvarchar](255) NULL, \t[State] [int] NOT NULL, \t[StateName] [nvarchar](255) NULL, \t[CreatedBy] [nvarchar](255) NULL, \t[CreatedDate] [datetime2](7) NOT NULL, \t[Discriminator] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL, \t[AppplicationName] [nvarchar](max) NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PK_AuditEntry] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  ( \t[AuditEntryID] ASC )WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON, OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY] ) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY] GO    AuditEntryProperty Table   CREATE TABLE [dbo].[AuditEntryProperty]( \t[AuditEntryPropertyID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, \t[AuditEntryID] [int] NOT NULL, \t[RelationName] [nvarchar](255) NULL, \t[PropertyName] [nvarchar](255) NULL, \t[OldValue] [nvarchar](max) NULL, \t[NewValue] [nvarchar](max) NULL, \t[Discriminator] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL, \t[AppplicationName] [nvarchar](max) NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PK_AuditEntryProperty] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  ( \t[AuditEntryPropertyID] ASC )WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON, OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY] ) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY] GO  ALTER TABLE [dbo].[AuditEntryProperty]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FK_AuditEntryProperty_AuditEntry_AuditEntryID] FOREIGN KEY([AuditEntryID]) REFERENCES [dbo].[AuditEntry] ([AuditEntryID]) ON DELETE CASCADE GO  ALTER TABLE [dbo].[AuditEntryProperty] CHECK CONSTRAINT [FK_AuditEntryProperty_AuditEntry_AuditEntryID] GO    Step 2: Create a asp.net core web api project name AuditLog.API   Step 3: Install the following nuget packages in the project.   System.Data.SqlClient   Step 4: Create a Model class name Product in Models folder.      Product class to store Product Information   Product.cs   namespace AuditLog.API.Models {     public class Product     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; } = String.Empty;         public decimal Price { get; set; } = 0;         public int Quantity { get; set; } = 0;     } }   Step 5: Create a DBConnector class in Persistence folder to create connection to the database   DBConnector.cs   using System.Data.SqlClient;  namespace AuditLog.API.Persistence {     // This class is used to create a connection to the database.     public class DBConnector : IDisposable     {         public SqlConnection connection;          public DBConnector(string connectionString)         {             connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);             this.connection.Open();         }          public void Dispose()         {             connection.Close();         }     } }    Step 6: Add connection string in appsettings.json file   appsettings.json   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\"     }   },   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=localhost;Database=AuditLogDB;User Id=sa;Password=YourPassword;TrustServerCertificate=True;\"   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\" }   Step 7: Create classes and enums for Audit Trail in AuditTrail folder      Create ApplicationEnum, StateName, EnumExtesions class in AuditTrail/Enums folder   ApplicationEnum.cs   using System.ComponentModel;  namespace AuditLog.API.AuditTrail.Enums {     // This enum is used to identify the names of applications that is being audited.     public enum ApplicationEnum     {         [Description(\"AuditLog.API\")]         AuditLogAPP,          [Description(\"ECommerce Application\")]         ECommerceAPP     } }    StateName.cs   namespace AuditLog.API.AuditTrail.Enums {     // State of the operation performed on the entity.     public enum StateName     {         EntityAdded,         EntityModified,         EntityDeleted     } }    EnumExtensions.cs    using System.ComponentModel; using System.Reflection;  namespace AuditLog.API.AuditTrail.Enums {     // This enum is used to identify the names of applications that is being audited.     public static class EnumExtensions     {         public static string GetApplication(this Enum value)         {             FieldInfo? fieldInfo = value.GetType().GetField(value.ToString());              DescriptionAttribute? attribute = fieldInfo?.GetCustomAttribute&lt;DescriptionAttribute&gt;();              return attribute != null ? attribute.Description : value.ToString();         }          public static string GetEntity(this Enum value)         {             FieldInfo? fieldInfo = value.GetType().GetField(value.ToString());              DescriptionAttribute? attribute = fieldInfo?.GetCustomAttribute&lt;DescriptionAttribute&gt;();              return attribute != null ? attribute.Description : value.ToString();         }     } }       Create IAuditTrail Interface in AuditTrail/Interface folder   IAuditTrail.cs   namespace AuditLog.API.AuditTrail.Interfaces {     public interface IAuditTrail&lt;T&gt;     {         void Insert(T entity);         void Update(T oldEntity, T newEntity);         void Delete(T oldEntity);     } }       Create AuditTrail class in AuditTrail/Implementaion folder   AuditTrail.cs   using AuditLog.API.AuditTrail.Enums; using AuditLog.API.AuditTrail.Interfaces; using AuditLog.API.Persistence; using System.Data; using System.Data.SqlClient; using System.Reflection;  namespace AuditLog.API.AuditTrail.Implementations {     // This class is used to insert audit log into database.     // This is the core class of the AuditTrail project.     public class AuditTrail&lt;T&gt;

ProductsController.cs    using AuditLog.API.Models; using AuditLog.API.Persistence; using AuditLog.API.Services.Interfaces; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;  namespace AuditLog.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase     {         private DBConnector _connector;         private readonly IProductService _productService;          public ProductsController( DBConnector connector, IProductService productService)         {             _connector = connector;             _productService = productService;         }          // GET: api/Products         [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt;&gt; GetProducts()         {             var products = await _productService.GetProducts();              if (products == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(products);         }          // GET: api/Products/5         [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; GetProduct(int id)         {             var product = await _productService.GetProduct(id);             if (product == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(product);         }          // PUT: api/Products/5         [HttpPut(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PutProduct(int id, Product product)         {             if (id != product.Id)             {                 return BadRequest();             }             var result = await _productService.UpdateProduct(product);             if (result == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(result);         }          // POST: api/Products         [HttpPost]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; PostProduct(Product product)         {             var result = await _productService.AddProduct(product);             if (result == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(result);         }          // DELETE: api/Products/5         [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteProduct(int id)         {             var result = await _productService.DeleteProduct(id);              if (result == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(result);         }     } }     ReportingController.cs    using AuditLog.API.Services.Interfaces; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;  namespace AuditLog.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class ReportingController : ControllerBase     {         private IReportingService _reportingService;         public ReportingController(IReportingService reportingService)         {             _reportingService = reportingService;         }         [HttpGet(\"GetChangeLogDynamic/{EntityName}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetChangeLogDynamic(string EntityName)         {             var result = await _reportingService.GetChangeLogDynamic(EntityName);             return Ok(result);         }     } }    Step 14: Run the application and check the swagger.     Now run application create, update and delete Customer entity using swagger   You will see audit trail logs in AuditEntry and AuditEntryProperty table.   You can also view a sample report using Reporting controller. In GetChangeLog end point use “Product” as entity name.     Source code  ","categories": ["ASP.NET","ASP.NET Core","C#","Web API"],

        "title": "Optimistic Concurrency Management in ASP.NET Core Application Using Raw SQL and ADO.NET",
        "excerpt":"In a previous article here, I discussed various ways to deal with concurrency. Optimistic concurrency is a common method for handling such situations. This article is designed to illustrate the practical aspects of managing optimistic concurrency in an ASP.NET Core application using raw SQL and ADO.NET.   Tools and Technology Used      ASP.net core Web API   Visual C#   Entity Framework   SQL Server   Step 1: Create a database in SQL Server name - ConcurrencySQLDB   Step 2: Create a table name Product     Run the following script to create the table   CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Products]( \t[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, \t[Name] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL, \t[Price] [decimal](18, 2) NOT NULL, \t[Quantity] [int] NOT NULL, \t[RowVersion] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PK_Products] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  ( \t[Id] ASC )WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON, OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY] ) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY] GO   Step 3: Create a asp.net core web api project name ConcurrencyHandling.API   Step 4: Install the following nuget packages in the project.   System.Data.SqlClient   Step 5: Create a Model class name Product in Models folder      Product class to store Product Information   In the following class RowVersion property is a Guid which is used to track the updated version of the record.   Product.cs    namespace Concurrency.API.Models {     public class Product     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; } = String.Empty;         public decimal Price { get; set; } = 0;         public int Quantity { get; set; } = 0;         public Guid RowVersion { get; set; }     } }    Step 6: Create a DBConnector class to connect with database in Persistence folder.   DBConnector.cs    using System.Data.SqlClient;  namespace Concurrency.API.Persistence {     // This class is used to create a connection to the database.     public class DBConnector : IDisposable     {         public SqlConnection connection;          public DBConnector(string connectionString)         {             connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);             this.connection.Open();         }          public void Dispose()         {             connection.Close();         }     } }     Step 7: Add connection string in appsettings.json file   appsettings.json   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\"     }   },   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=localhost;Database=ConcurrencySQLDB;User Id=sa;Password=MyPassword;TrustServerCertificate=True;\"   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\" }    Step 8: Create IProductRepository in Repositories/Interface folder   IProductRepository.cs   using Concurrency.API.Models;  namespace Concurrency.API.Repositories.Interfaces {     public interface IProductRepository     {         Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt; GetProducts();         Task&lt;Product&gt; GetProduct(int id);         Task&lt;Product&gt; AddProduct(Product product);         Task&lt;Product&gt; UpdateProduct(Product product);         Task&lt;Product&gt; DeleteProduct(int id, Guid rowVersion);     } }    Step 9: Create ProductRepository in Repositories/Implementation folder   ProductRepository.cs   using Concurrency.API.Models; using Concurrency.API.Persistence; using Concurrency.API.Repositories.Interfaces; using System.Data; using System.Data.SqlClient;  namespace Concurrency.API.Repositories.Implementations {     public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository     {         private DBConnector _connector;         public ProductRepository(DBConnector dBConnector)         {             _connector = dBConnector;         }         public Task&lt;Product&gt; AddProduct(Product model)         {             try             {                    if(this._connector.connection.State == ConnectionState.Closed)                     this._connector.connection.Open();                 var cmd = this._connector.connection.CreateCommand() as SqlCommand;                 SqlTransaction transaction = this._connector.connection.BeginTransaction(\"\");                 cmd.Transaction = transaction;                 cmd.CommandText = @\"INSERT INTO Products (Name, Price, Quantity, RowVersion)                  OUTPUT inserted.Id                                 VALUES (@Name, @Price, @Quantity, @RowVersion); SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY();\";                  Guid rowVersion = Guid.NewGuid();                 cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@Name\", model.Name);                 cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@Price\", model.Price);                 cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@Quantity\", model.Quantity);                 cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@RowVersion\", rowVersion);                  // cmd.ExecuteScalar() returns the first column of the first row in the result                 // set returned by the query.

You will see, row version is checked while updating or deleting rows.   Step 10: Create IProductService in Services/Interfaces class   IProductService.cs   using Concurrency.API.Models;  namespace Concurrency.API.Services.Interfaces {     public interface IProductService     {         Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt; GetProducts();         Task&lt;Product&gt; GetProduct(int id);         Task&lt;Product&gt; AddProduct(Product product);         Task&lt;Product&gt; UpdateProduct(Product product);         Task&lt;Product&gt; DeleteProduct(int id, Guid rowVersion);     } }    Step 11: Create ProductService in Services/Implementation class   ProductService.cs    using Concurrency.API.Models; using Concurrency.API.Repositories.Interfaces; using Concurrency.API.Services.Interfaces;  namespace Concurrency.API.Services.Implementations {     public class ProductService : IProductService     {         IProductRepository _productRepository;         public ProductService(IProductRepository productRepository)         {             _productRepository = productRepository;         }         public Task&lt;Product&gt; AddProduct(Product product)         {             return _productRepository.AddProduct(product);         }          public Task&lt;Product&gt; GetProduct(int id)         {             return _productRepository.GetProduct(id);         }          public Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt; GetProducts()         {             return _productRepository.GetProducts();         }          public Task&lt;Product&gt; UpdateProduct(Product product)         {             return _productRepository.UpdateProduct(product);         }          public Task&lt;Product&gt; DeleteProduct(int id, Guid rowVersion)         {             return _productRepository.DeleteProduct(id, rowVersion);         }     } }    Step 12: Configure Program class as follows.   Program.cs   using Concurrency.API.Persistence; using Concurrency.API.Repositories.Implementations; using Concurrency.API.Repositories.Interfaces; using Concurrency.API.Services.Implementations; using Concurrency.API.Services.Interfaces;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container.  builder.Services.AddControllers(); // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();   string connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\"); builder.Services.AddTransient(_ =&gt; new DBConnector(connectionString));  builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IProductRepository, ProductRepository&gt;(); builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IProductService, ProductService&gt;();  var app = builder.Build();  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     app.UseSwagger();     app.UseSwaggerUI(); }  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  app.Run();     Step 13: Create a Controller class ProductsController in Controllers folder.   ProductsController.cs    using Concurrency.API.Models; using Concurrency.API.Persistence; using Concurrency.API.Services.Interfaces; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;  namespace Concurrency.API.Controllers {     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [ApiController]     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase     {         private DBConnector _connector;         private readonly IProductService _productService;          public ProductsController( DBConnector connector, IProductService productService)         {             _connector = connector;             _productService = productService;         }          // GET: api/Products         [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;&gt;&gt; GetProducts()         {             var products = await _productService.GetProducts();              if (products == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(products);         }          // GET: api/Products/5         [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; GetProduct(int id)         {             var product = await _productService.GetProduct(id);             if (product == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(product);         }          // PUT: api/Products/5         [HttpPut(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PutProduct(int id, Product product)         {             if (id != product.Id)             {                 return BadRequest();             }             var result = await _productService.UpdateProduct(product);             if (result == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(result);         }          // POST: api/Products         [HttpPost]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;Product&gt;&gt; PostProduct(Product product)         {             var result = await _productService.AddProduct(product);             if (result == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(result);         }          // DELETE: api/Products/5         [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteProduct(int id, Guid rowVersion)         {             var result = await _productService.DeleteProduct(id, rowVersion);              if (result == null)             {                 return NotFound();             }             return Ok(result);         }     } }      Step 14: Run the application and test concurrency      Create a new record by Post method in swagger. Sample example for post data.   {   \"id\": 0,   \"name\": \"ASUS Laptop\",   \"price\": 1200,   \"quantity\": 230 }      Update the record using the Put method in Swagger. A sample input is provided below. Meanwhile, open another tab and make an update to the record. Your record version will be altered. If you attempt to update the record using the previous record version, it will not updated due to concurrency. However, if no one else has updated it and you are using the correct record version, you can update the record.   {     \"id\": 5,     \"name\": \"ASUS Laptop\",     \"price\": 1300,     \"quantity\": 230,     \"rowVersion\": \"04e92587-8c5d-4a27-b5d5-bbee9fc84458\" }      Delete the record using the Delete method in Swagger. Meanwhile, open another tab and update the record. Your record version will be changed. If you attempt to delete the record using the previous record version, it will throw an exception due to concurrency. However, if no one else has updated it and you are using the correct record version, you can delete the record without encountering any problem.

        "title": "Utilizing Bulk Operations with Entity Framework and ASP.NET Core",
        "excerpt":"A bulk operation refers to the execution of a single operation that involves multiple data entries or rows in a database, typically performed in a batch. Instead of processing each entry individually, bulk operations allow for the manipulation or retrieval of data in a more efficient manner.   The benefits of bulk operations include:           Improved Performance: By processing multiple data entries in a single operation, bulk operations can significantly reduce the overhead associated with multiple individual operations, resulting in improved performance and reduced latency.            Reduced Resource Usage: Bulk operations require fewer resources compared to performing the same task iteratively on each data entry. This can lead to better utilization of system resources and improved scalability.            Enhanced Throughput: With the ability to handle large volumes of data more efficiently, bulk operations can increase the throughput of data processing tasks, allowing applications to handle higher workloads without sacrificing performance.            Minimized Database Overhead: Bulk operations can help minimize the overhead on the database server by reducing the number of transactions and communication overhead associated with processing individual data entries.            Simplified Code Logic: By consolidating multiple operations into a single bulk operation, developers can write simpler and more concise code, leading to easier maintenance and reduced complexity in application logic.       To perform bulk operations in an ASP.NET Core application, we can leverage the capabilities of Entity Framework Core and the EFCore.BulkExtensions library. This article will explore the practical implementation of bulk operations using these tools, providing insights into how to optimize database operations and enhance application performance.   EFCore BulkExtensions   EFCore.BulkExtensions is a popular library that extends the functionality of Entity Framework Core by providing support for bulk operations such as bulk insert, update, delete, and merge. This library offers a convenient and efficient way to perform bulk operations on database entities, allowing developers to streamline data processing tasks and improve application performance.   In this article, we will focus on the following bulk operations using EFCore.BulkExtensions and Entity Framework Core.   Tools and Technology Used      ASP.net core Web API   Visual C#   Entity Framework   EFCore.BulkExtensions   SQL Server   Step 1: Create a asp.net core web api project name EFBulkBatch   Step 2: Install the following nuget packages in the project.   EFCore.BulkExtensions Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools   Step 3: Create two Model class name Customer and Employee in Models folder      Customer class will be used to perform bulk operation using Entity Framework.   Employee class will be used to perform bulk operation using EFCore.BulkExtensions.   Customer.cs    namespace EFBulkBatch.Models {     public class Customer     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public string Email { get; set; }         public string Phone { get; set; }      } }    Employee.cs    namespace EFBulkBatch.Models {     public class Employee     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public string Designation { get; set;}         public string Department { get; set; }      } }    Step 4: Create Db Context class name ApplicationDbContext in Db folder.   ApplicationDbContext.cs    using EFBulkBatch.Models; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;  namespace EFBulkBatch.Db {     public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext     {         public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt; options) : base(options)         {                      }                  public DbSet&lt;Employee&gt; Employees { get; set; }         public DbSet&lt;Customer&gt; Customers { get; set; }     } }     Step 5: Create CustomerService class in Manager folder to perform bulk operation using Entity Framework.   Manager/CustomerService.cs   using EFBulkBatch.Db; using EFBulkBatch.Models;  namespace EFBulkBatch.Managers {     public class CustomerService     {         private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;         private DateTime _startTime;         private TimeSpan _elapsedTime;         public CustomerService(ApplicationDbContext context)          {             _context = context;         }           public async Task&lt;TimeSpan&gt; AddBulkCustomerAsync()         {             // C# 9.0 feature: Target-typed new expressions             List&lt;Customer&gt; customers = new();             _startTime = DateTime.Now;              for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++)             {                 customers.Add(new Customer                 {                     Name = $\"Customer {i}\",                     Email = $\"Email {i}\",                     Phone = $\"Phone {i}\"                 });             }              // Use AddRange to add multiple entities             _context.Customers.AddRange(customers);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();             _elapsedTime = DateTime.Now - _startTime;             return _elapsedTime;         }          public async Task&lt;TimeSpan&gt; UpdateBulkCustomerAsync()         {             // C# 9.0 feature: Target-typed new expressions             List&lt;Customer&gt; customers = new();             _startTime = DateTime.Now;             for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++)             {                 customers.Add(new Customer                 {                     Id = i + 1,                     Name = $\"Update Customer {i}\",                     Email = $\"Update Email {i}\",                     Phone = $\"Update Phone {i}\"                 });             }              // Use UpdateRange to update multiple entities             _context.Customers.UpdateRange(customers);               await _context.SaveChangesAsync();              _elapsedTime = DateTime.Now - _startTime;             return _elapsedTime;         }          public async Task&lt;TimeSpan&gt; DeleteBulkCustomerAsync()         {             List&lt;Customer&gt; customers = _context.Customers.ToList();             _startTime = DateTime.Now;              // Use RemoveRange to delete multiple entities             _context.Customers.RemoveRange(customers);             await _context.SaveChangesAsync();             _elapsedTime = DateTime.Now - _startTime;             return _elapsedTime;         }     } }   Step 6: Create EmployeeService class in Manager folder to perform bulk operation using EFCore.BulkExtensions.   Manager/EmployeeService.cs   using EFBulkBatch.Db; using EFBulkBatch.Models; using EFCore.BulkExtensions;  namespace EFBulkBatch.Managers {     public class EmployeeService     {         private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;         private DateTime _startTime;         private TimeSpan _elapsedTime;          public EmployeeService(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)         {             _dbContext = dbContext;         }          public async Task&lt;TimeSpan&gt; AddBulkDataAsync()         {             // C# 9.0 feature: Target-typed new expressions             List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new();             _startTime = DateTime.Now;              for(int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++)             {                 employees.Add(new Employee                 {                     Name = $\"Employee {i}\",                     Designation = $\"Designation {i}\",                     Department = $\"Department {i}\"                 });             }                        // Use BulkInsertAsync to add multiple entities             await _dbContext.BulkInsertAsync(employees);             _elapsedTime = DateTime.Now - _startTime;             return _elapsedTime;         }           public async Task&lt;TimeSpan&gt; UpdateBulkDataAsync()         {             // C# 9.0 feature: Target-typed new expressions             List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new();             _startTime = DateTime.Now;             for(int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++)             {                 employees.Add(new Employee                 {                     Id = i + 1,                     Name = $\"Update Employee {i}\",                     Designation = $\"Update Designation {i}\",                     Department = $\"Update Department {i}\"                 });             }              // Use BulkUpdateAsync to update multiple entities             await _dbContext.BulkUpdateAsync(employees);             _elapsedTime = DateTime.Now - _startTime;             return _elapsedTime;         }          public async Task&lt;TimeSpan&gt; DeleteBulkDataAsync()         {             // C# 9.0 feature: Target-typed new expressions             List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = _dbContext.Employees.ToList();             _startTime = DateTime.Now;              // Use BulkDeleteAsync to delete multiple entities             await _dbContext.BulkDeleteAsync(employees);             _elapsedTime = DateTime.Now - _startTime;             return _elapsedTime;         }       } }    Step 7: Add connection string in appsettings.json file   appsettings.json   {   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\"     }   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\",   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=.;Database=EFBulkBatchDB; User Id = sa; Password = YourPassword; TrustServerCertificate=True;\"   } }    Step 8: Configure Program class as follows.

        "title": "Understanding CRON Expressions: A Complete Guide",
        "excerpt":"What is a CRON Expression?   A CRON expression is a string representing a schedule for executing tasks at specific time intervals. It is commonly used in scheduling jobs in operating systems, cloud services, and automation tools like Azure Functions, Kubernetes, and Unix-based systems.   A CRON expression consists of multiple fields defining the execution time of a scheduled task. The format may vary slightly depending on the system, but the most common format consists of five or six fields:   *  *  *  *  *  * |  |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  |  +---- Day of the week  (0-6, Sunday = 0 or 7) |  |  |  |  +------ Month (1-12) |  |  |  +--------- Day of the month (1-31) |  |  +------------ Hour (0-23) |  +--------------- Minute (0-59) +------------------ Second (0-59) [Only in some systems like Azure Functions]   Why is a CRON Expression Used? CRON expressions are used to schedule tasks automatically without manual intervention. Common use cases include:      Automating system tasks – Running backups, log rotation, and system maintenance.   Executing scheduled scripts – Running batch jobs or automated reports at specific times.   Cloud function scheduling – Triggering AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.   Database maintenance – Running periodic data cleanups, index rebuilds, or ETL processes.   CI/CD pipelines – Scheduling automated deployments or build processes.   How is a CRON Expression Used? CRON expressions are used in various platforms and services. Here are a few common implementations:      Unix/Linux CRON Jobs:            Add scheduled tasks in the crontab file using crontab -e.       Example: 0 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh (Runs a script every day at 2:00 AM)           Azure Functions:            Uses a six-field CRON format (including seconds).       Example: \"0 0 * * * *\" (Runs every hour on the hour)           Kubernetes CronJobs:            Defines scheduled jobs in Kubernetes clusters.                Example YAML definition:           apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: CronJob metadata:   name: example-cronjob spec:   schedule: \"0 12 * * *\"  # Runs every day at 12:00 PM                           Examples of CRON Expressions                  CRON Expression       Meaning                       0 0 * * * *       Runs every hour on the hour                 */5 * * * * *       Runs every 5 seconds (Azure Functions)                 0 */15 * * * *       Runs every 15 minutes                 0 0 12 * * ?       Runs every day at 12:00 PM                 0 0 1 * * ?       Runs on the 1st of every month at midnight                 0 0 0 * * 1       Runs every Monday at midnight           Conclusion   CRON expressions are a powerful tool for scheduling tasks in various environments. Whether used for system automation, cloud functions, or database maintenance, understanding CRON syntax helps optimize workflow efficiency. By mastering CRON expressions, you can ensure that tasks run at precise intervals without manual intervention.  ","categories": ["ASP.NET","ASP.NET Core","C#","Web API","EF"],

        "title": "Step-by-Step Guide to Running Jekyll Minimal Mistake Blog on Windows",
        "excerpt":"Jekyll is a fantastic tool for building static websites, and the Minimal Mistakes theme offers a professional, clean design for blogs. This guide will walk you through the steps to build, run, and deploy your Jekyll blog on Windows and host it on GitHub Pages.   Step 1: Install Ruby and Development Kit      Download and install Ruby+Devkit from RubyInstaller. During installation, ensure you select the option to add Ruby executables to your PATH.        Configure Ruby and the Development Kit:        ridk install                Verify the installation:        ruby --version  gem --version           Step 2: Install Jekyll and Bundler           Install Bundler, the Ruby dependency manager:        gem install bundler                Install Jekyll:        gem install jekyll                Confirm the installation:        jekyll --version           Step 3: Create Your Blog with Minimal Mistakes Theme           Clone the Minimal Mistakes starter repository:        git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git my-blog                Navigate to your blog directory:        cd my-blog           Install project dependencies:      bundle install           Serve the blog locally to preview it:      bundle exec jekyll serve           Open your browser and visit:      http://localhost:4000           Step 4: Customize Your Blog           Update Configuration:   Edit _config.yml to personalize your blog’s title, description, author, and other settings.            Add Posts:   Add new blog posts in the _posts folder. Use the format:       YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md           *Customize Pages:     Create new pages (e.g., about.md) and link them in _config.yml.   Step 5: Deploy Your Blog to GitHub Pages      Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:     git init git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\"           Create a new repository on GitHub and link it to your local project:     git remote add origin &lt;repository-url&gt; git branch -M main git push -u origin main           Enable GitHub Pages:            Go to your GitHub repository’s Settings.       Under Pages, set the branch to main and the folder to / (root).       Save your changes.           Your blog will be live at:     https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository-name&gt;/           Build and deploy release for production     Go to the root direcotry of the project. Ex. My-blog   Open terminal and run command jekyll build site.url   Go to the site directory. Ex. My-blog/site   Copy the content of the site directory   Go to the root directory of the repository on GitHub. Ex. mahedee.github.io   Paste the content to the root directory   Commit and push the changes to the repository on GitHub both my-blog and mahedee.github.io   Now browse the site using: https://mahedee.github.io/   Troubleshooting          Changing the Site URL for Production              You don’t need to manually change links when switching between development and production. Instead, set the “url” parameter in _config.yml.       This approach has two benefits:                    When running jekyll serve, the site.url is set to http://localhost:4000.           When running jekyll build, the site.url is replaced with the domain name specified in _config.yml.                       After building, deploy the contents of the _site directory to the root of your server where your domain points.

        "title": "Understanding Different Kinds of Kubernetes Resources",
        "excerpt":"Kubernetes, a leading container orchestration platform, is designed to simplify the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. Central to Kubernetes are its resources, each tailored for specific tasks like running applications, managing storage, or ensuring smooth communication between components. Understanding these resources is crucial for leveraging Kubernetes to its full potential.   Here’s a comprehensive guide to the most commonly used Kubernetes resources, their purposes, and use cases.   1. Pod The Pod is the smallest and most basic deployable unit in Kubernetes. A Pod encapsulates one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace and storage.   Purpose:     To host application containers, often one per Pod.   Acts as the building block for higher-level abstractions like Deployments.   Use Case:     Deploying simple applications or debugging purposes.   Example:  apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: hrm-pod spec:   containers:     - name: hrm-container       image: mh17acr.azurecr.io/hrm:latest       ports:         - containerPort: 8080   2. Deployment A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages a group of Pods. It handles updates, scaling, and fault tolerance for stateless applications.   Purpose:     To ensure a specific number of replicas are running.   Supports rolling updates and rollbacks.   Use Case:     Deploying scalable, stateless applications.   Example:  apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: hrm-deployment spec:   replicas: 3   selector:     matchLabels:       app: hrm-api   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: hrm-api     spec:       containers:         - name: hrm-container           image: mh17acr.azurecr.io/hrm:latest           ports:             - containerPort: 8080   3. Service A Service provides a stable network endpoint for accessing a group of Pods. It abstracts the dynamic nature of Pods and exposes them through a fixed IP or DNS.   Purpose:     To route traffic to Pods, regardless of their lifecycle.   Supports load balancing.   Use Case:     Connecting frontend applications to backend APIs.   Example:  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: hrm-service spec:   selector:     app: hrm-api   ports:     - protocol: TCP       port: 80       targetPort: 8080   type: ClusterIP   4. ConfigMap A ConfigMap is used to store non-sensitive configuration data as key-value pairs. This allows configuration changes without rebuilding container images.   Purpose:     To decouple configuration from application logic.   Use Case:     Managing application settings like environment variables.   Example:  apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata:   name: hrm-config data:   environment: production   log_level: debug   5. Secret A Secret securely stores sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and keys. Unlike ConfigMaps, Secrets encode data in Base64 for security.   Purpose:     To securely manage sensitive data.   Use Case:     Storing database credentials or API keys.   Example:  apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata:   name: hrm-secret type: Opaque data:   password: bXlwYXNzd29yZA== # Base64 encoded \"mypassword\"   6. StatefulSet A StatefulSet manages stateful applications, ensuring each Pod has a unique, stable identity and persistent storage.   Purpose:     To deploy applications that require stable Pod identities and ordered deployment.   Use Case:     Databases, distributed systems, or applications requiring persistent storage.   Example:  apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: StatefulSet metadata:   name: hrm-db spec:   serviceName: \"hrm-db-service\"   replicas: 2   selector:     matchLabels:       app: hrm-db   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: hrm-db     spec:       containers:         - name: mysql-container           image: mysql:5.7           ports:             - containerPort: 3306   7. Job A Job runs tasks to completion, such as batch processing or database migrations. It ensures the task is retried upon failure.   Purpose:     To run one-time or short-lived tasks.   Use Case:     Running a data import job or executing scripts.   Example:  apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata:   name: hrm-job spec:   template:     spec:       containers:         - name: hrm-task           image: busybox           command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo 'Hello, Kubernetes!'\"]       restartPolicy: Never   backoffLimit: 4   8. CronJob A CronJob schedules Jobs at specific times, like a cron job in Linux.   Purpose:     To run periodic tasks automatically.   Use Case:     Running backups, generating reports, or performing maintenance tasks.   Example:  apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: CronJob metadata:   name: hrm-cronjob spec:   schedule: \"0 3 * * *\" # Run daily at 3 AM   jobTemplate:     spec:       template:         spec:           containers:             - name: hrm-task               image: busybox               command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo 'Scheduled Task'\"]           restartPolicy: OnFailure   9. PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) A PersistentVolume (PV) represents physical storage in the cluster, while a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) requests specific storage resources from a PV.   Purpose:     To manage persistent storage for stateful applications.   Use Case:     Storing database data or application logs.   Example:  # PersistentVolume apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata:   name: hrm-pv spec:   capacity:     storage: 5Gi   accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce   hostPath:     path: /data/hrm  # PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata:   name: hrm-pvc spec:   accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce   resources:     requests:       storage: 5Gi   Conclusion Kubernetes resources provide powerful abstractions to deploy, manage, and scale applications in a cloud-native way. By understanding these resource types and their purposes, you can design robust, scalable, and secure architectures tailored to your application’s needs. Whether you’re deploying a stateless microservice or managing a complex stateful database, Kubernetes has the tools to make it easier.

        "title": "Using Azure Functions Timer Trigger for Seamless Cache Auto-Refresh in Real-World Applications",
        "excerpt":"What is Azure Functions? Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Azure Functions to run code in response to events such as HTTP requests, timer triggers, blob storage, queue messages, and more. Azure Functions is a great way to build serverless applications that scale automatically and only pay for the resources you use. Azure Functions supports multiple programming languages including C#, JavaScript, Python, and PowerShell. It is called serverless because you don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Azure Functions takes care of scaling, monitoring, and managing the infrastructure for you. You can focus on writing code and building applications without worrying about the infrastructure.   Different Types of Functions      Timer Trigger: It is a function that runs on a schedule. You can specify the schedule using a cron expression. The function will run at the specified time.   HTTP Trigger: It is a function that runs when an HTTP request is received. You can specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the route. The function will run when an HTTP request is received at the specified route.   Blob Trigger: It is a function that runs when a blob is added or updated in a storage account. You can specify the storage account and the container. The function will run when a blob is added or updated in the specified container.   Queue Trigger: It is a function that runs when a message is added to a queue in a storage account. You can specify the storage account and the queue. The function will run when a message is added to the specified queue.   Event Grid Trigger: It is a function that runs when an event is published to an event grid topic. You can specify the event grid topic. The function will run when an event is published to the specified topic.   Event Hub Trigger: It is a function that runs when an event is received from an event hub. You can specify the event hub. The function will run when an event is received from the specified event hub.   RabbitMQ Trigger: It is a function that runs when a message is received from a RabbitMQ queue. You can specify the RabbitMQ queue. The function will run when a message is received from the specified queue.   Service Bus Queue Trigger: It is a function that runs when a message is added to a queue in a service bus namespace. You can specify the service bus namespace and the queue. The function will run when a message is added to the specified queue.   Service Bus Topic Trigger: It is a function that runs when a message is added to a topic in a service bus namespace. You can specify the service bus namespace and the topic. The function will run when a message is added to the specified topic.   Durable Functions: It is a function that runs a workflow. You can specify the workflow using code or an orchestration. The function will run the workflow.   Cosmos DB Trigger: It is a function that runs when a document is added or updated in a Cosmos DB database. You can specify the Cosmos DB database and the collection. The function will run when a document is added or updated in the specified collection.   SignalR Service Trigger: It is a function that runs when a message is received from a SignalR service. You can specify the SignalR service. The function will run when a message is received from the specified service.   Some real-world examples of Azure Functions are:     A function that runs on a schedule to update exchange rates in a cache   A function that sends an email when a new record is added to a database   A function that runs when a message is added to a queue   A function that runs when an event is published to an event grid topic   A function that runs when a document is added or updated in a Cosmos DB database   A function that runs when a message is received from a RabbitMQ queue   A function that processes images uploaded to a blob storage account   What is Redis? Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used as a database, message broker, or cache in your applications. Redis is a key-value store that stores data in memory for fast access. Redis is a popular choice for caching because it is fast, scalable, and reliable. Redis supports multiple data structures including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes.   Some real-world examples of Redis are:     A cache for storing frequently accessed data i.e. user sessions, product catalog, etc.   A database for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly i.e. user profiles, product details, etc.   A leader board for storing scores and rankings i.e. game scores, user rankings, etc.   Implementation   Step 1: Create a azure timer function     Open Visual Studio   Select File -&gt; New -&gt; Project   Select “Azure Functions” template   Enter the project name, i.e, “CacheRefreshAzureFunction”, specify the Location and Solution name, i.e, “CacheRefreshFunction”, and click Next   Select Functions worker as .NET Framework Isolated v4. I will discuss the different Functions later.   Select Function as Timer Trigger   Uncheck the “Use Azureite for runtime storage account” and “Enable container support” checkbox. I will discuss about these later.   Keep the default Schedule value as “0 */5 * * * *” which means the function will run every 5 minutes. You can change the value later.   Click Create   Note: Different Types of Functions workers     .NET Framework Isolated v4: This is the default option. It is a .NET 5 based worker. It is a new worker and it is recommended to use this worker for new projects. The isolated worker is a new worker that runs in a separate process from the runtime. This means that the worker can run on a different version of .NET than the runtime. This allows you to use the latest version of .NET with your functions.   .NET Framework v1: This is the old worker. It is based on .NET Core 3.1. It is recommended to use this worker for old projects.   Step 2: Run Redis in Docker Let’s run Redis in a Docker container to run azure function locally. Assume you have Docker installed on your machine.      Run docker desktop on your machine   Open a powershell terminal   Run the following command to run the Redis container   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-cache redis      Run the following command to check if the Redis container is   docker ps     Run the following command to connect to the Redis container   docker exec -it redis-cache redis-cli      Run the following command to set a key-value pair in Redis   set key value example: set name \"John Doe\"      Run the following command to get the value of a key in Redis   get key  example: get name     Run the following command to exit the Redis CLI   exit   Step 3: Set redis connection string in windows environment variable Let’s set the Redis connection string in the Windows environment variable to use it in the Azure Function App. I will use environment variable to get the Redis connection string in the Azure Function App.      Open the PowerShell   Run the following command to set the Redis connection string in the Windows environment variable   setx RedisConnectionString \"localhost:6379\"           setx command is used to set the value of an environment variable. Since, Redis is running on localhost and the default port is 6379, I have set the value as “localhost:6379”.            Run the following command in Powershell Terminal to get the Redis connection string from the Windows environment variable       echo $env:RedisConnectionString     Or, run the following command in command prompt to get the Redis connection string from the Windows environment variable   echo %RedisConnectionString%   Step 4: Install Nuget Packages in CacheRefreshAzureFunction Project Install the following Nuget packages in the CacheRefreshAzureFunction project   Install-Package StackExchange.Redis Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json   Step 5: Modify the Azure Function App in Local Machine     Click on the Solution file -&gt; CacheRefreshFunction.sln to open the solution in Visual Studio   Rename the Function1.cs file to CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction.cs   Open the CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction.cs file   Modify the CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction class as follows   using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq; using StackExchange.Redis; using System; using System.Net.Http; using System.Threading.Tasks;  namespace CacheRefreshAzureFunction {     public class CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction     {         private readonly ILogger _logger;         private static readonly HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();          public CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)         {             _logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger&lt;CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction&gt;();         }          [Function(\"CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction\")]         public async Task RunAsync([TimerTrigger(\"*/5 * * * * *\")] ScheduleTimerInfo timerInfo)         {             _logger.LogInformation($\"Cache refresh function executed at: {DateTime.UtcNow}\");              try             {                 // Fetch fresh data from API (e.g., Exchange Rates API)                 string apiUrl = \"https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD\";                 string responseData = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(apiUrl);                  // Connect to Redis Cache                 // ConnectionMultiplexer object is used to connect to the Redis server                 // IDatabase object is used to interact with the Redis database                 string cacheConnectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"RedisConnectionString\")?.Trim();                     ConnectionMultiplexer redis = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(cacheConnectionString);                 IDatabase cache = redis.GetDatabase();                  // Store data in Redis Cache (Cache expiration: 5 minutes)                 // Cache expiration means that the stored data will be automatically removed from the cache after 5 minutes.                 // This helps ensure that the cache does not hold stale data and is refreshed periodically.                 cache.StringSet(\"ExchangeRates\", responseData, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));                  // Retrieve data from cache                 _logger.LogInformation(\"Exchange rates updated successfully in Redis Cache.\");                  // Retrieve data from cache                 string cachedData = cache.StringGet(\"ExchangeRates\");                   // Show the cached data in the log                  if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(cachedData))                 {                     // Parse the JSON response                     var exchangeRates = JObject.Parse(cachedData);                      // Extract specific rates                     var usdToBdt = exchangeRates[\"rates\"][\"BDT\"].Value&lt;decimal&gt;();                     var usdToCad = exchangeRates[\"rates\"][\"CAD\"].Value&lt;decimal&gt;();                      _logger.LogInformation(\"Current exchange rate:\");                     _logger.LogInformation($\"USD to BDT: {usdToBdt}\");                     _logger.LogInformation($\"USD to CAD: {usdToCad}\");                 }                 else                 {                     _logger.LogWarning(\"Cache is empty! Data retrieval failed.\");                 }             }             catch (Exception ex)             {                 _logger.LogError($\"Error updating and retrieving cache: {ex.Message}\");             }              if (timerInfo.IsPastDue)             {                 _logger.LogWarning(\"The function is running later than scheduled.\");             }              timerInfo.Last = DateTime.Now;             timerInfo.Next = timerInfo.Last.AddSeconds(5);         }     }      public class ScheduleTimerInfo     {         public DateTime Last { get; set; } = DateTime.Now;         public DateTime Next { get; set; } = DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(5);          // This property is used to determine if the timer is past due         // It defines a method that returns true if the current time is greater than the Next property         public bool IsPastDue =&gt; DateTime.Now &gt; Next;     } }           Here, I have created a CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction class that contains a RunAsync method. The RunAsync method is decorated with the Function attribute and takes a ScheduleTimerInfo parameter. The RunAsync method is responsible for refreshing the cache at regular intervals. The method fetches fresh data from an API (e.g., Exchange Rates API), stores the data in a Redis cache, and retrieves the data from the cache. The method logs the exchange rates in the console.            [TimerTrigger(“*/5 * * * * *”)] attribute is used to specify the schedule of the function. In this case, the function will run every 5 seconds. */5 * * * * * is a cron expression.            You can use https://crontab.cronhub.io/ to generate the cron expression.            To know more about cron expression, read my article on Cron Expression            Now run the project and you will see the logs in the console as follows       [2025-02-23T01:42:52.477Z] Exchange rates updated successfully in Redis Cache. [2025-02-23T01:42:52.503Z] Current exchange rate: [2025-02-23T01:42:52.503Z] USD to CAD: 1.42 [2025-02-23T01:42:52.503Z] USD to BDT: 121.53   Step 6: Create Redis Cache in Azure     Log in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/)   Click on Create a resource group and enter the resource group name, i.e., “myresourcegroup”, Location i.e., “West US” and click on Review + Create   Search “Azure Cache for Redis” and click on Create   Select Azure Cache for Redis   Select the Subscription, Resource Group i.e. myresourcegroup, DNS name i.e. exrateredis, Location i.e. West US, Cache type i.e. Standard, Pricing tier i.e. Basic C0 and click on Review + Create   Click on Create   Wait for the deployment to complete. It may take a few minutes.   Step 7: Deploy the Azure Function App to Azure     Right-click on the project in Visual Studio and select Publish   In the next screen, select Target as Azure and click on Next   Select Your Azure Subscription and click on Create New   Type the App Name, Subscription, Resource Group, Hosting Plan and click on Create as shown below   Here, I have created an Application Insights which is used to monitor the Azure Function App. I will use it later to see the logs as output.   Select Function Name and click on Next   Select Publish and click on Finish   Click on Publish button to deploy the Azure Function App to Azure   Wait for the deployment to complete   Click on the Browse button to open the Azure Function App in the browser      Step 8: Add Redis Connection String in Environment Variable in Azure Function App     Click on “Azure Cache for Redis” in the Azure Portal   Click on recent cache name i.e. exrateredis   Click Settings -&gt; Authentication   Click on Access keys tab   Uncheck “Disable Access Keys Authentication” checkbox and click on Save   Copy the Primary connection string which is used to connect to the Redis Cache   Click on the Azure Function App i.e. “CacheRefreshAzureFunction198412” in the Azure Portal   Click on Settings -&gt; Environment variables   Select App Settings and click on Add button   Enter the Name as “RedisConnectionString” and Value as the copied Primary connection string and click on Apply as shown below      Step 9: Set Firewall Rule in Azure Cache for Redis     Click on your deployed Azure Function i.e. “CacheRefreshAzureFunction198412” in the Azure Portal   Click on Properties tab of overview section, you will find the Outbound IP Addresses   Now, sort the Outbound IP Addresses and copy the first IP Address and last IP Address   Click on Redis Cache i.e. exrateredis in the Azure Portal   Click on Settings -&gt; Firewall   Click on Add button   Enter the Name as “AzureFunctionApp” and Start IP as the copied first IP Address and End IP as the copied last IP Address.   Save the changes to apply the firewall rule.   Click on Settings -&gt; Private Endpoint and click on Enable Public Network Access and click on Save as below      Step 10: Test the Azure Function App in Azure     Click on the Azure Function App i.e. “CacheRefreshAzureFunction198412” in the Azure Portal   Click on Functions -&gt; CacheRefreshTimerTriggerFunction   Click on Logs to see the logs   You will see the logs as follows.

        "title": "Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying an ASP.NET Core Application with Azure Kubernetes Services, Azure SQL Server, and Azure Container Registry",
        "excerpt":"What is Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)?  Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure. It offers a simplified way to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes. AKS is a fully managed service that eliminates the complexity of managing Kubernetes clusters, allowing you to focus on building and deploying your applications.   What is Azure SQL Server? Azure SQL Server is a managed relational database service provided by Microsoft Azure. It offers a scalable, secure, and fully managed database service that is compatible with SQL Server. Azure SQL Server provides high availability, automatic backups, and built-in security features to protect your data.   What is Azure Container Registry (ACR)? Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed container registry provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to store and manage container images securely in the cloud. ACR integrates with Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) to simplify the deployment of containerized applications.   In this article, you’ll learn how to deploy an ASP.NET Core application using Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), Azure SQL Server, and Azure Container Registry (ACR). The steps below assume you have some basic familiarity with ASP.NET Core, Azure services, and Docker.   Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure you have the following:     An Azure subscription (create a free account if you don’t have one)   Azure CLI installed on your local machine   Docker Desktop installed on your local machine   Visual Studio or any other code editor   Basic knowledge of ASP.NET Core, Docker, and Kubernetes   Kubectl installed on your local machine   Step 1: Create an Azure SQL Database     Open the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account.   Click on the “Create a resource” button and search for “SQL Database”.   Click on the “Create” button to create a new SQL Database.   Fill in the required details like server name, database name, resource group, and pricing tier.   Click on the “Review + create” button to create the SQL Database.   or     Login to Azure CLI   az login      Create a resource group for the SQL Server and Database   Create a SQL Server and Database using Azure CLI   # Create a resource group az group create --name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --location &lt;Location&gt;  # Create a SQL Server az sql server create --name &lt;SqlServerName&gt; --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --location &lt;Location&gt; --admin-user &lt;AdminUser&gt; --admin-password &lt;AdminPassword&gt;  # Create a SQL Database with the S0 pricing tier az sql db create --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --server &lt;SqlServerName&gt; --name &lt;DatabaseName&gt; --service-objective S0   Example of creating a SQL Server and Database using Azure CLI:   # Create a resource group named myresourcegroup in the westus location az group create --name myresourcegroup --location westus  # Create a SQL Server named myserver in the myresourcegroup resource group with the admin user mahedee and password mypass@123 az sql server create --name mahedeesqlserver --resource-group myresourcegroup --location westus --admin-user mahedee --admin-password mypass@123  # Create a SQL Database named mydatabase in the myresourcegroup resource group with the S0 pricing tier az sql db create --resource-group myresourcegroup --server mahedeesqlserver --name HRMDB --service-objective S0      Set Up Firewall Rules Allow your local machine or AKS to access the SQL server.   Try to connect to the SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio to verify the connection.   You will get a message that the IP address is not allowed to access the server.   It will show the IP address range that is need to be added to the firewall rules.   Collect start and end IP address range from the error message and add the IP address range to the firewall rules using the Azure CLI.   # Allow your local machine to access the SQL server az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group myresourcegroup --server mahedeesqlserver --name AllowLocalMachine --start-ip-address &lt;YourIPAddress&gt; --end-ip-address &lt;YourIPAddress&gt;   # Example: Allow your local machine to access the SQL server az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group myresourcegroup --server mahedeesqlserver --name AllowLocalMachine --start-ip-address 162.237.182.0 --end-ip-address 162.237.182.255   Step 2: Create an ASP.NET Core Application      Create a new ASP.NET Core application using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.   Install the required NuGet packages for Azure SQL Database and Entity Framework Core.   Configure the connection string to your Azure SQL Database.   Create the required models and DbContext for your application.   Add the required services and middleware to your application.   Build and run your ASP.NET Core application locally to test it.   In this Article I have created an asp.net core web api application name HRM.API. Source of the application is given at the end of the article.           Now create a Dockerfile in the root of your project to containerize your ASP.NET Core application.            I have added lot of comments in the Dockerfile to explain each step.       Dockerfile   # Define the base image # Use the official ASP.NET Core runtime image the alias base sets here to use it in the next stage  # Switches the execution to a user named app. This is a security best practice to avoid running as root. # The app user must exist in the aspnet:8.0 image. If not, this command will fail unless the user is created beforehand.  # Sets the working directory to /app. All subsequent commands in this stage will be relative to this directory.  # Informs Docker that the container will listen on ports 8080 and 8081.  # This is for documentation purposes and does not expose the ports to the host by itself; you need to publish these ports explicitly with docker run -p.  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base USER app WORKDIR /app EXPOSE 8080 EXPOSE 8081   # Define the Build Stage # Use the official ASP.NET Core SDK image to build the application # Set the working directory to /src. This directory will be existing only in the build stage. # Copies all files from the current directory on the host machine to the /src directory in the container. # Restores project dependencies from the .csproj file. This ensures all necessary NuGet packages are downloaded. # Builds the application in Release configuration and outputs the compiled files to the /app directory inside the container. FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build WORKDIR /src COPY . . RUN dotnet restore RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app  # Final State # Use the base image defined in the first stage. # Set the working directory to /app. # Copies the compiled application from the build stage to the /app directory in the final image. # Defines the command to run when the container starts. Here, it launches the application by executing the .NET runtime to run the HRM.API.dll file. FROM base AS final WORKDIR /app COPY --from=build /app . ENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"HRM.API.dll\"]  # You can see only the app directory in the final image because Multi-stage builds isolate the content of each stage from the other stages. # Docker multi-stage build process implicitly discards everything in the intermediate stages when the final stage is built.      Build and Test the Docker Image Locally   # Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile docker build -t hrm:latest .  # Run the Docker image locally docker run -p 8080:8080 hrm:latest   Access your application at http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html to verify it works.   Step 3: Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)     Open the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account.   Click on “Create a resource” and search for “Container Registry”.   Select “Container Registry” and click on “Create”.   Fill in the required details like registry name, resource group, location, and SKU.   Click on “Review + create” and then “Create” to create the ACR.   or     Create an Azure Container Registry using Azure CLI   # Create a resource group for the ACR # Since we already have a resource group, we can skip this step az group create --name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --location &lt;Location&gt;  # Create an ACR az acr create --name &lt;ACRName&gt; --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --sku Basic --location &lt;Location&gt;   Example of creating an Azure Container Registry using Azure CLI:   # Create a resource group named myresourcegroup in the westus location # Since we already have a resource group, we can skip this step az group create --name myresourcegroup --location westus  # Create an ACR named myacr in the myresourcegroup resource group with the Basic SKU az acr create --name mh17acr --resource-group myresourcegroup --sku Basic --location westus   Step 4: Push the Docker Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)     Tag the Docker image with the ACR URL. Tagging the image with the ACR URL is required to push the image to the ACR.   Log in to the ACR using the Azure CLI.   Push the Docker image to the ACR.   # Tag the Docker image with the ACR URL docker tag hrm:latest &lt;ACRName&gt;.azurecr.io/hrm:latest # Login to the ACR using the Azure CLI az acr login --name &lt;ACRName&gt; # Push the Docker image to the ACR docker push &lt;ACRName&gt;.azurecr.io/hrm:latest  Example of pushing a Docker image to Azure Container Registry using Azure CLI:   # Tag the Docker image with the ACR URL docker tag hrm:latest mh17acr.azurecr.io/hrm:latest # Login to the ACR using the Azure CLI az acr login --name mh17acr # Push the Docker image to the ACR docker push mh17acr.azurecr.io/hrm:latest     Verify that the Docker image is successfully pushed to the ACR by checking the ACR in the Azure portal. or using Azure CLI   # List the repositories in the ACR az acr repository list --name &lt;ACRName&gt; --output table  Example of listing the repositories in the ACR using Azure CLI:     # List the repositories in the ACR   az acr repository list --name mh17acr --output table   Step 5: Create an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) Cluster     Open the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account.   Click on the “Create a resource” button and search for “Kubernetes Service”.   Click on “Create” to create a new AKS cluster.   Fill in the required information, such as the resource group, location, and cluster name.   Basics Tab:            Subscription: Choose your Azure subscription.       Resource Group: Create a new resource group or select an existing one.       Kubernetes Cluster Name: Enter a unique name for your AKS cluster.       Region: Select the region for your cluster.       Click “Next: Node Pools” to proceed.           Node Pools Tab:            Click “Add a node pool” to add a new node pool.       Node Pool Name: Enter a name for the node pool.       Virtual Machine Size: Choose the VM size for the node pool.       Node Count: Enter the number of nodes in the pool.       Click “Next: Authentication” to proceed.           Authentication Tab:            Leave the default settings for authentication.       Click “Next: Networking” to proceed.           Networking Tab:            Leave the default settings for networking.       Click “Next: Monitoring” to proceed.           Monitoring Tab:            Enable monitoring if required.       Click “Next: Tags” to proceed.           Tags Tab:            Add any required tags to the cluster.       Click “Next: Review + create” to proceed.           Review + create Tab:            Review the cluster configuration.       Click “Create” to create the AKS cluster.           Click on “Review + create” and then “Create” to create the AKS cluster.   Once the cluster is created, click on the “Connect” button to connect to the cluster using kubectl.   or     Create an AKS cluster using Azure CLI   # Create a resource group for the AKS cluster az group create --name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --location &lt;Location&gt; # Create an AKS cluster az aks create --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --name &lt;AKSName&gt; --node-count &lt;NumberOfNodes&gt; --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys  Example of creating an AKS cluster using Azure CLI:   # Create a resource group for the AKS cluster # Since we already have a resource group, we can skip this step az group create --name myresourcegroup --location westus  # Create an AKS cluster az aks create --resource-group myresourcegroup --name myakscluster --node-count 1 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys --location westus --kubernetes-version 1.29.9 --node-vm-size Standard_B2s --enable-cluster-autoscaler --min-count 1 --max-count 3  Note: Sometimes, CLI commands may not work due to the version of the CLI. In that case, you can use the Azure portal to create the AKS cluster.      Now Connect to the AKS cluster. Use the following command to connect to the AKS cluster:   az aks get-credentials --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --name &lt;AKSName&gt;   Example of connecting to an AKS cluster using Azure CLI:   # Connect to the AKS cluster az aks get-credentials --resource-group myresourcegroup --name myakscluster  # Output Merged \"myakscluster\" as current context in /Users/username/.kube/config      To get the list of contexts, run the following command:   kubectl config get-contexts     To switch to a different context, run the following command:   kubectl config use-context &lt;ContextName&gt;   Step 6: Link ACR(Azure Container Registry) to AKS If the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster is not linked to your ACR, Kubernetes cannot pull the image.   Run the following command to allow AKS to access your ACR:   az aks update -n &lt;aks-cluster-name&gt; -g &lt;resource-group-name&gt; --attach-acr mh17acr   Example of linking an ACR to an AKS cluster using Azure CLI:   # Link the ACR to the AKS cluster az aks update -n myakscluster -g myresourcegroup --attach-acr mh17acr    Step 7: Deploy the ASP.NET Core Application to AKS      Connect to the AKS cluster   az aks get-credentials --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --name &lt;AKSName&gt;   Example of connecting to an AKS cluster using Azure CLI:   # Connect to the AKS cluster az aks get-credentials --resource-group myresourcegroup --name myakscluster  # Output Merged \"myakscluster\" as current context in /Users/username/.kube/config      To get the list of contexts, run the following command:   kubectl config get-contexts     To switch to a different context, run the following command:   kubectl config use-context &lt;ContextName&gt;      Create a Kubernetes Pod for the ASP.NET Core application        Here I used lots of comments to explain each section of the yaml file. You can remove the comments before using it.       pod_aks.yml        apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod # Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes and it represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. metadata: # Metadata section provides information about the Pod   name: hrm-pod # Name of the Pod. Name must be unique within the namespace.   labels:       # Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users.     app: hrm-api  # Specification for the Pod spec:   containers: # List of containers within the Pod     - name: hrm-ctr       image: mh17acr.azurecr.io/hrm:latest        ports:         - containerPort: 8080 # Port that the container will expose       env: # List of environment variables to set in the container         - name: ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection # Name of the environment variable.

In this access the application using the following URL:   http://52.137.187.193:8011/swagger/index.html      To delete the pod and service, use the following commands:   kubectl delete -f pod_aks.yml kubectl delete -f service_aks.yml      Command to get log of a pod     kubectl logs -f hrm-pod           Trouble Shooting: Application cannot connect to the Azure SQL Database     Run the following command to check the logs of the pod to identify any connection issues:     kubectl logs -f hrm-pod           You will get the error message in the logs if there is any issue connecting to the Azure SQL Database.   It says AKS pod cannot connect to the Azure SQL Database. It will show source IP address is not allowed to access the server.   To resolve this issue, you need to allow the AKS cluster’s IP address to access the Azure SQL Database.   Run the following command to set up the firewall rule to allow the AKS cluster’s IP address to access the Azure SQL Database:     az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --server &lt;SqlServerName&gt; --name AllowAKSIP --start-ip-address 13.64.73.58 --end-ip-address 13.64.73.58          Example:      az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; --server &lt;SqlServerName&gt; --name AllowAKSIP --start-ip-address 13.64.73.58 --end-ip-address 13.64.73.58           After setting up the firewall rule, try to access the Azure SQL Database from the AKS pod again. The connection should be successful now.   Kubernetes pods ip address can be changed after restart. So, it is better to use static ip address for the AKS cluster.   Common Commands:      To update azur CLI run the following command:   az upgrade      To know the region of the AKS cluster, run the following command:     az aks show -n &lt;aks-cluster-name&gt; -g &lt;resource-group-name&gt; --query location -o tsv           To know the region of the Azure SQL Database, run the following command:     az sql server show -n &lt;sql-server-name&gt; -g &lt;resource-group-name&gt; --query location -o tsv           To know the ip address of the AKS cluster, run the following command:     az aks show -n &lt;aks-cluster-name&gt; -g &lt;resource-group-name&gt; --query outboundIpAddresses -o tsv           To get list of contexts, run the following command:     kubectl config get-contexts           To switch to a different context, run the following command:     kubectl config use-context &lt;context-name&gt;           kubectl get pods --watch  # Watch the pods in the current namespace      To get the logs of a pod, run the following command:     kubectl logs -f &lt;pod-name&gt;           To get the logs of a pod in a specific container, run the following command:     kubectl logs -f &lt;pod-name&gt; -c &lt;container-name&gt;           Describe a pod     kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;           To get the details of a pod, run the following command:     kubectl get pod &lt;pod-name&gt; -o yaml           Source code  ","categories": ["ASP.NET Core","Kubernetes","SQL Server","Docker","Azure","DevOps","Microservices"],

        "title": "How to Configure SSL and HTTPS for RabbitMQ in Docker",
        "excerpt":"Securing RabbitMQ with SSL/TLS and enabling HTTPS access for the Management UI is essential to protect data and ensure a secure environment. This guide walks you through the steps to set up RabbitMQ with SSL/TLS on Docker Desktop and enable HTTPS for the Management UI. Follow along to configure RabbitMQ to handle encrypted AMQP connections as well as a secure Management interface.   Prerequisites   To follow this guide, you’ll need:     Docker Desktop: Installed and running on your machine.   RabbitMQ Configuration Files: Basic familiarity with RabbitMQ configurations and SSL certificates.   OpenSSL: To create self-signed certificates if needed.   Step 1: Create SSL/TLS Certificates   To secure RabbitMQ over SSL, you’ll need three key files:     ca_certificate.pem: Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. This file is required for RabbitMQ to validate client certificates.   server_certificate.pem: Server certificate signed by the CA. This file is used by RabbitMQ to authenticate itself to clients.   server_key.pem: Private key for the server certificate. This file is used by RabbitMQ to decrypt incoming client requests.   Creating Self-Signed Certificates   1: Create a Certificate Authority (CA)   First, create a CA certificate to sign the server certificate.   1.1 Generate a private key for the CA:      openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca_key.pem -aes256      You’ll be prompted to create a passphrase for the CA key. Remember this, as it will be needed to sign certificates.   1.2 Generate a CA certificate:      openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca_key.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -out ca_certificate.pem      You’ll be asked to fill out details for the CA certificate (such as country, organization, etc.). This will generate the ca_certificate.pem file.   You can keep everything blank if you’re creating a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.   2: Create the Server Certificate and Key   Next, create the server certificate that RabbitMQ will use, signed by your CA.   2.1. Generate a private key for the server:      openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server_key.pem   2.2. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the server certificate:      openssl req -new -key server_key.pem -out server_csr.pem      You’ll be prompted to enter details for the server. Be sure to set Common Name (CN) to the server’s hostname or IP address, as clients will check this when verifying the server’s identity.   You can keep other fields blank for testing purposes.   2.3. Sign the server certificate with the CA:      openssl x509 -req -in server_csr.pem -CA ca_certificate.pem -CAkey ca_key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server_certificate.pem -days 3650 -sha256      This step signs the server_certificate.pem with ca_certificate.pem, creating a valid SSL certificate for the server. The -CAcreateserial flag creates a ca_certificate.srl file that manages the CA’s serial numbers for certificates.   After completing the above steps, you should have these files:      ca_certificate.pem: The CA certificate file used to verify server identity.   server_certificate.pem: The server’s signed certificate file.   server_key.pem: The server’s private key file.   These files can now be used in the docker-compose.yml setup you configured earlier. Ensure the certificates are placed in the correct certs directory and that permissions are set to secure access to the private key (server_key.pem).   Step 2: Set Up rabbitmq.conf for SSL and HTTPS   RabbitMQ requires configurations to enable SSL for AMQP client connections (on port 5671) and HTTPS for the Management UI (on port 15671). Let’s create a rabbitmq.conf file with these configurations:   # SSL settings for the main AMQP listener (used for client connections over SSL/TLS) listeners.ssl.default = 5671                     # AMQP listener over SSL/TLS on port 5671 ssl_options.cacertfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/ca_certificate.pem  # Path to the CA certificate to verify client certificates ssl_options.certfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/server_certificate.pem # Path to the server certificate for RabbitMQ ssl_options.keyfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/server_key.pem         # Path to the server private key for SSL ssl_options.verify = verify_peer                # Requires clients to present valid certificates (mutual authentication) ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true         # Disconnects clients if they don't present a valid certificate  # Enable HTTPS for the management interface management.listener.port = 15671                # Port for accessing RabbitMQ Management UI over HTTPS management.listener.ssl = true                  # Enable SSL for the management UI listener management.listener.ip = 0.0.0.0                # Bind to all available network interfaces to accept external connections  # SSL options for HTTPS management listener management.listener.ssl_opts.cacertfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/ca_certificate.pem  # CA certificate for HTTPS verification management.listener.ssl_opts.certfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/server_certificate.pem # Server certificate for HTTPS management.listener.ssl_opts.keyfile = /etc/rabbitmq/certs/server_key.pem         # Private key for HTTPS management.listener.ssl_opts.verify = verify_none          # Allows clients to access without presenting a client certificate management.listener.ssl_opts.fail_if_no_peer_cert = false  # Does not require client certificates for HTTPS access    In this configuration:     AMQP (5671): The verify_peer and fail_if_no_peer_cert options enforce strict client certificate validation.   Management UI (15671): Allows HTTPS access without requiring client certificates.   Save this file as rabbitmq.conf.   Step 3: Configure docker-compose.yml for RabbitMQ   To set up RabbitMQ with the configurations and certificates, we need to update docker-compose.yml:   version: '3.8'  services:   rabbitmq:     image: rabbitmq:3-management     container_name: rabbitmq     ports:       - \"5671:5671\"         # RabbitMQ SSL port       - \"15671:15671\"       # RabbitMQ management plugin port     environment:       RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: user             # Default username       RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: password         # Default password     volumes:       - rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq      # Data persistence       - ./certs:/etc/rabbitmq/certs          # Mount the certs directory of local machine to the container directory       - ./rabbitmq.conf:/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf  # Custom RabbitMQ configuration file. This file is used to enable SSL and configure the SSL certificates. rabbitmq.conf file is mounted to the container directory /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf     command: [\"rabbitmq-server\"]            # Start the RabbitMQ server. This command is used to start the RabbitMQ server with the custom configuration file.  volumes:   rabbitmq_data:  #rabbitmq_data is mounted to /var/lib/rabbitmq inside the container. RabbitMQ stores its data in /var/lib/rabbitmq by default, so mounting a persistent volume to this location ensures that data generated by RabbitMQ is saved in the rabbitmq_data volume.    Explanation of the Volume Mounts      rabbitmq_data: Ensures RabbitMQ data (queues, exchanges, etc.) persist across container restarts.   ./certs: Mounts the local certificates folder to /etc/rabbitmq/certs inside the container, where RabbitMQ can access them.   ./rabbitmq.conf: Mounts the custom configuration file into /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf inside the container.   The folder structure as follows:  rabbitmq-ssl │   docker-compose.yml │   rabbitmq.conf │   certs/ │       ca_certificate.pem │       server_certificate.pem │       server_key.pem   Step 4: Start RabbitMQ and Verify SSL Configuration           Run the following command to start the RabbitMQ container with HTTPS and SSL enabled:       docker-compose up -d                Verify that RabbitMQ is listening on the correct ports:      docker ps          You should see ports 5671 (for AMQP over SSL) and 15671 (for HTTPS management) mapped.       Step 5: Access the RabbitMQ Management UI over HTTPS   Open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:15671. If you’re using a self-signed certificate, you’ll likely see a security warning. Proceed by accepting the certificate to access the Management UI.   Step 6: Configure AMQP Clients for SSL Connections   For applications or services that connect to RabbitMQ over AMQP, use the following settings:     URL: amqps://localhost:5671   CA Certificate: ca_certificate.pem (for client validation)   Client applications should verify the RabbitMQ server certificate by using ca_certificate.pem. Depending on the client library, you may need to specify additional SSL options.   Troubleshooting Tips      Permissions: Ensure that the .pem files are readable by the RabbitMQ process inside the container.   SSL/TLS Version Compatibility: Some clients may have specific SSL/TLS requirements. Ensure your configuration aligns with the client’s requirements.   Conclusion   Setting up RabbitMQ with SSL/TLS and enabling HTTPS access for the Management UI greatly enhances security, especially in production environments. With these configurations, RabbitMQ can securely handle both AMQP client connections and browser-based management over HTTPS.   Following these steps, you’ll have a robust, secure RabbitMQ instance that protects your data in transit and allows safe administration.   Note for docker container:     docker exec -it rabbitmq bash - access the container terminal, rabbitmq is the container name   docker exec -it rabbitmq ls -l /etc/rabbitmq/certs - list the certs in the container   You can access container terminal from docker desktop as follows:            Click on the container       Click on Termianl tab          ","categories": ["RabbitMQ","Docker","SSL"],

        "title": "Boost Your Productivity - Setting Up and Customizing Windows Terminal with Git Bash and Oh My Posh",
        "excerpt":"Windows Terminal is a versatile and powerful tool that allows you to work with multiple command-line environments in one place, including PowerShell, Command Prompt, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), and now Git Bash. By customizing Windows Terminal with “Oh My Posh”, you can enhance your productivity with better themes, prompt customization, intellisence and more. This guide will walk you through configuring Windows Terminal, setting up Oh My Posh, integrating Git Bash, and switching between different terminal profiles.   Step 1: Install Windows Terminal   Before we dive into customizations, make sure Windows Terminal is installed on your system.      Install Windows Terminal via the Microsoft Store:            Open the Microsoft Store on your Windows PC.       Search for Windows Terminal and click Install.           Or, install it using the following PowerShell command:        winget install --id Microsoft.WindowsTerminal -e --source winget           Step 2: Install and Set Up Git Bash   Git Bash is a popular terminal for developers who want a Unix-like experience on Windows. It comes bundled with Git for Windows. To integrate Git Bash into Windows Terminal:      Download Git for Windows:            Go to Git for Windows and download the installer.       Follow the installation instructions. Ensure that the option “Git Bash Here” is selected, so you can access Git Bash easily from your terminal.       You can also install Git for Windows using the following command:            winget install Git.Git -e --source winget                Add Git Bash to Windows Terminal: Once installed, you’ll need to add Git Bash as a profile in Windows Terminal.              Open Windows Terminal and go to Settings (press Ctrl + , or click on the drop-down menu and select Settings).                In the Settings window, click on Profiles and then click on the Open JSON file button.                        In the profiles.json file, scroll down to the \"profiles\" section and add Git Bash as a new profile like this:           {     \"guid\": \"{some-guid-here}\",     \"hidden\": false,     \"name\": \"Git Bash\",     \"commandline\": \"\\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\\\" --login -i\",     \"icon\": \"ms-appx:///ProfileIcons/git-bash.png\",     \"startingDirectory\": \"%USERPROFILE%\" }                       Replace {some-guid-here} with a new GUID. You can generate a new GUID using a tool like GUID generator.       Save the file and close the editor.           or,             You can also add it by clicking on the “+” button in the profiles section called “Add a new profile”       Click on New empty profile       Name the profile “Git Bash”       Add the commandline \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\" --login -i or browse to the location of the bash.exe file.       Icon: You can find the Git Bash icon in the Git installation directory. For example, C:\\Program Files\\Git\\mingw64\\share\\git\\git-for-windows.ico.        - Starting Directory: %USERPROFILE%        - Save the profile.           Switch to Git Bash:            Once you’ve saved the profile, Git Bash will now be available in the Windows Terminal dropdown menu.       Simply select Git Bash from the profiles list, and you can start using it in the same terminal window.           Step 3: Install PowerShell Core (Optional)   While Git Bash is now available, you might want to also use PowerShell Core (the cross-platform version of PowerShell). To install PowerShell Core:      Download PowerShell Core from the official GitHub repository.   Follow the installation instructions for your system.   Add PowerShell Core to Windows Terminal:            In Windows Terminal Settings, add a new profile for PowerShell Core by specifying the path to pwsh.exe.       Save the settings.           Step 4: Install a Font with Powerline Symbols    To display special symbols properly, install a Powerline font like CaskaydiaCove or FiraCode from the Nerd Fonts website.     Download the font and install it on your system.   In my case, I have used CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font.   Or, copy the font to the font directory: C:\\Windows\\Fonts.   Set the installed font in Windows Terminal under Settings &gt; Profiles &gt; PowerShell &gt; Appearance &gt; Font face.   Step 5: Install and Set Up Oh My Posh for PowerShell   Oh My Posh is a prompt theme engine for PowerShell that can beautify your terminal with themes, segments, and additional functionality. To install it:      Install Oh My Posh:            Go to https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows and follow the instructions to set up Oh My Posh.   or,       Open a PowerShell prompt and run the following command:              winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget      This installs a couple of things:            oh-my-posh.exe - Windows executable       themes - The latest Oh My Posh themes       You can find the themes in the directory C:\\Users\\{your-username}\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\oh-my-posh\\themes.           Run following command to update oh-my-posh       winget upgrade JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget           Run the following command to check oh-my-posh installed or not     oh-my-posh --version  or oh-my-posh.exe              Configure Powershell Profile:            Open PowerShell and run the following command to edit your profile. If you don’t have a profile, a window will prompt you to create one. or you can create a profile in the directory C:\\Users\\{your-username}\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.            notepad $PROFILE                           Add the following lines to the profile script to enable Oh My Posh:           oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression                                For advanced feature, I have customized my profile script. You can copy and paste it into your profile script. Here is my profile script. https://gist.github.com/mahedee/f7468bd2c59fa463235e877a8d719f98                   Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1          using namespace System.Management.Automation    using namespace System.Management.Automation.Language           if ($host.Name -eq 'ConsoleHost')    {        Import-Module PSReadLine    }      Import-Module -Name Terminal-Icons     # oh-my-posh init pwsh --config C:\\Users\\mahedee\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\oh-my-posh\\themes\\jandedobbeleer.omp.json | Invoke-Expression    oh-my-posh init pwsh --config C:\\Users\\mahedee\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\oh-my-posh\\themes\\myposh-mahedee.omp.json | Invoke-Expression    # oh-my-posh init pwsh --config C:\\Users\\mahedee\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\oh-my-posh\\themes\\myposh-hanselman.omp.json | Invoke-Expression    # oh-my-posh init pwsh --config C:\\Users\\mahedee\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\oh-my-posh\\themes\\cobalt2.omp.json | Invoke-Expression     Register-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName winget -ScriptBlock {        param($wordToComplete, $commandAst, $cursorPosition)            [Console]::InputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = $OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Utf8Encoding]::new()            $Local:word = $wordToComplete.Replace('\"', '\"\"')            $Local:ast = $commandAst.ToString().Replace('\"', '\"\"')            winget complete --word=\"$Local:word\" --commandline \"$Local:ast\" --position $cursorPosition | ForEach-Object {                [System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]::new($_, $_, 'ParameterValue', $_)            }    }     # PowerShell parameter completion shim for the dotnet CLI    Register-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName dotnet -ScriptBlock {        param($commandName, $wordToComplete, $cursorPosition)            dotnet complete --position $cursorPosition \"$wordToComplete\" | ForEach-Object {                [System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]::new($_, $_, 'ParameterValue', $_)            }    }     # ---      # This is an example profile for PSReadLine.    #    # This is roughly what I use so there is some emphasis on emacs bindings,    # but most of these bindings make sense in Windows mode as well.     # Searching for commands with up/down arrow is really handy.

        "title": "Observer Design Pattern: Create a Real-Time Stock Market Notification System in C#",
        "excerpt":"What is the Observer Design Pattern? The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to be notified of changes to other objects’ states. It establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where the subject (the object being observed) maintains a list of observers (objects that are interested in its state) and notifies them of any changes.   Why use the Observer Design Pattern? The Observer pattern is useful when you need to notify multiple objects of changes to a single object’s state without tightly coupling them. It promotes loose coupling between objects, making it easier to maintain and extend the system. It is commonly used in event-driven systems, such as GUI frameworks, real-time monitoring systems, and notification systems.   Key components of the Observer Design Pattern:     Subject: The object being observed, which maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes to its state.   Observer: The object that is interested in the subject’s state and receives notifications when the subject’s state changes.   Concrete Subject: A specific implementation of the subject that contains the state to be observed.   Concrete Observer: A specific implementation of the observer that receives notifications from the subject.   Attach / Registration: The process of adding an observer to the subject’s list of observers.   Detach / Deregistration: The process of removing an observer from the subject’s list of observers.   Notify: The process of notifying all observers of changes to the subject’s state.   UML Class Diagram of the Observer Design Pattern:      How to implement the Observer Design Pattern in C#?   namespace ObserverPattern {     // IObserver interface is used to update all the observers     public interface IObserver     {         // Update method is called when the subject changes         void Update(string state);     }      // Interface for the subject     // It has methods to attach, detach and notify the observers     public interface ISubject     {         void Attach(IObserver observer);         void Detach(IObserver observer);         void Notify();     }      // Concreate Subject class     public class ConcreateSubject : ISubject     {         // List of observers attached to the subject         private List&lt;IObserver&gt; _observers = new List&lt;IObserver&gt;();         private string _subjectState;          public string SubjectState         {             get =&gt; _subjectState;              // When the state changes of subject, notify all the observers             set             {                 _subjectState = value;                 // Call Notify method to notify all the observers                 Notify();              }         }          public void Attach(IObserver observer)         {             _observers.Add(observer);         }          public void Detach(IObserver observer)         {             _observers.Remove(observer);         }          // Notify all the observers         public void Notify()         {             // Call Update method of all the observers attached to the subject             foreach (var observer in _observers)             {                 observer.Update(_subjectState);             }         }     }      // Concrete Observer class     public class ConcreateObserver : IObserver     {         // Used to set the name of the observer         private string _observerName;          public ConcreateObserver(string name)         {             _observerName = name;         }         public void Update(string state)         {             Console.WriteLine($\"{_observerName} received update: State changed to {state}\");         }     }       internal class Program     {         static void Main(string[] args)         {             // Create a subject             ConcreateSubject subject = new ConcreateSubject();              // Create observers             IObserver observer1 = new ConcreateObserver(\"Observer-1\");             IObserver observer2 = new ConcreateObserver(\"Observer-2\");             IObserver observer3 = new ConcreateObserver(\"Observer-3\");              // Attach the observers to the subject             subject.Attach(observer1);             subject.Attach(observer2);             subject.Attach(observer3);              // Change the state of the subject             Console.WriteLine(\"Changing state to State 1\");             subject.SubjectState = \"State-1\";              Console.WriteLine(\"Changing state to State 2\");             subject.SubjectState = \"State-2\";              // Detach observer 1             subject.Detach(observer1);              Console.WriteLine(\"Changing state to State 3\");             subject.SubjectState = \"State-3\";              Console.ReadLine();         }     } }   Output  Changing state to State 1 Observer-1 received update: State changed to State-1 Observer-2 received update: State changed to State-1 Observer-3 received update: State changed to State-1 Changing state to State 2 Observer-1 received update: State changed to State-2 Observer-2 received update: State changed to State-2 Observer-3 received update: State changed to State-2 Changing state to State 3 Observer-2 received update: State changed to State-3 Observer-3 received update: State changed to State-3   Use Case: Real-Time Stock Market Notification System Imagine a stock market application where traders are notified every time the price of a stock changes. In this scenario, the stock price is the subject, and the traders are the observers. When the price of a stock changes, all the traders who are interested in that stock should be notified of the change. Let’s implement this use case using the Observer Design Pattern in C#.   UML Class Diagram of the Real-Time Stock Market Notification System:      Implementation of the Real-Time Stock Market Notification System in C#   Step 1: Define the Observer Interface The observer interface provides a common contract for all observers to implement.   public interface IObserver {     void Update(string symbol, decimal price); }  Step 2: Define the Subject Interface The subject interface defines the methods to register, unregister, and notify observers. Here we define it as IStock.   public interface IStock {     void Register(IObserver observer);     void Unregister(IObserver observer);     void Notify(); }   Step 3: Implement the Stock Class The Stock class is a concrete subject that maintains the stock price and notifies the observers when the price changes.   public class Stock : IStock {     private string _symbol;     private decimal _price;     private List&lt;IObserver&gt; _observers = new List&lt;IObserver&gt;();      public Stock(string symbol, decimal price)     {         _symbol = symbol;         _price = price;     }      public void Register(IObserver observer)     {         _observers.Add(observer);     }      public void Unregister(IObserver observer)     {         _observers.Remove(observer);     }      // If the price changes, notify the observers (traders)     // Here we are calling the Notify method     public void UpdatePrice(decimal price)     {         _price = price;         Notify();     }     public void Notify()     {         foreach (var observer in _observers)         {             observer.Update(_symbol, _price);         }     } }   Step 4: Implement the Trader Class The Trader class is a concrete observer that receives notifications when the stock price changes.    public class Trader : IObserver  {      // The observer's name      private string _name;       public Trader(string name)      {          _name = name;      }      public void Update(string symbol, decimal price)      {          Console.WriteLine($\"Notified {_name} of {symbol}'s price change to {price}\");      }  }   Step 5: Implement the Main Program In the main program, we create a stock object and register traders as observers. When the stock price changes, the traders are notified.   public class Program {      static void Main(string[] args)     {         // Create a stock         Stock stock = new Stock(\"MSFT\", 100.00m);          // Create some traders         Trader joe = new Trader(\"Joe\");         Trader sally = new Trader(\"Sally\");          // Register/subscribe the traders         Console.WriteLine(\"Registering Joe and Sally\");         stock.Register(joe);         stock.Register(sally);          Console.WriteLine(\"Changing stock price to 105.00m\");         // Change the stock price         stock.UpdatePrice(105.00m);          // Change the stock price         Console.WriteLine(\"Changing stock price to 110.00m\");         stock.UpdatePrice(110.00m);          // Unregister/unsubscribe a trader         Console.WriteLine(\"Unregistering Joe\");         stock.Unregister(joe);          Console.WriteLine(\"Changing stock price to 115.00m\");         // Change the stock price         stock.UpdatePrice(115.00m);     } }  Now, when you run the program, you should see the following output:   Output  Registering Joe and Sally Changing stock price to 105.00m Notified Joe of MSFT's price change to 105.00 Notified Sally of MSFT's price change to 105.00 Changing stock price to 110.00m Notified Joe of MSFT's price change to 110.00 Notified Sally of MSFT's price change to 110.00 Unregistering Joe Changing stock price to 115.00m Notified Sally of MSFT's price change to 115.00   Happy coding!

        "title": "Leveraging the Observer Design Pattern : 10 Real-World Examples in Action",
        "excerpt":"The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object (the subject) to notify multiple dependent objects (the observers) about changes in its state without knowing who or what those observers are. This pattern is widely used in software systems that require real-time updates or notifications. In this article, we will explore 10 real-world applications where the Observer Pattern is used to enable real-time communication, updates, or notifications.   1. Social Media Notifications   Description: Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, notify users of likes, comments, shares, and messages. These notifications keep users engaged and informed of activities on their posts and accounts they follow.   Observer: Users who follow posts, pages, or accounts and receive updates about activities on them.   Subject: Posts, accounts, or events that trigger notifications.   How It Works: When a user subscribes to a post or account, the system treats them as observers. When an activity (like, comment, share) occurs on the post, the platform (subject) notifies all the users observing it.   2. Chat Applications   Description: Messaging platforms, like WhatsApp and Slack, send real-time notifications to users when they receive new messages or mentions. This allows users to stay up-to-date with conversations even when they aren’t actively looking at the app.   Observer: Members of a chat group or users in a direct message thread.   Subject: The chat group or message thread where new messages are posted.   How It Works: Users subscribe to chat groups or message threads. When a new message is posted, the system (subject) notifies all users observing that group or conversation.   3. Online Shopping and Stock Alerts   Description: E-commerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay use the Observer Pattern to notify users about price changes, product restocks, or special promotions.   Observer: Customers who subscribe to updates for specific products.   Subject: The product or offer being tracked by the customer.   How It Works: Customers subscribe to specific products, and when any change occurs (e.g., price drop, availability), the platform (subject) notifies all users who have subscribed to that product.   4. Event-Driven Monitoring Systems   Description: IT infrastructure monitoring tools, such as Nagios and Datadog, monitor various metrics (e.g., server uptime, CPU usage, or disk space) and alert system administrators when an issue arises.   Observer: System administrators or monitoring teams who need real-time alerts.   Subject: The monitored system or resource, such as a server or application.   How It Works: The system (subject) tracks key metrics (e.g., CPU usage). If the metric crosses a predefined threshold, the system triggers a notification to all observers (admins) who are subscribed to the metric.   5. News Feed Subscriptions   Description: News platforms like Google News, BBC, and CNN allow users to follow specific topics, authors, or categories. When a new article is published under a subscribed category or by a followed author, users are notified immediately.   Observer: Users who subscribe to categories or authors.   Subject: Articles or content within a specific category or published by a specific author.   How It Works: When new content is published, the platform (subject) sends real-time updates to all users who are observing the particular topic or author.   6. Gaming Leaderboards   Description: Online games, like Fortnite or PUBG, notify players of leaderboard changes, upcoming challenges, or rewards.   Observer: Players who track the game’s leaderboard or their in-game performance.   Subject: The game’s leaderboard or event system.   How It Works: Players subscribe to notifications about leaderboard updates. When their rank changes or when a new event is available, the game (subject) sends an update to the players observing the leaderboard.   7. IoT Systems   Description: Smart home devices, such as thermostats (Nest), security cameras, and smart lights, notify users of changes or status updates in real time.   Observer: Homeowners or users accessing the smart home system via an app or device.   Subject: IoT devices, such as cameras, thermostats, or motion detectors.   How It Works: The IoT system (subject) monitors connected devices. When a change occurs (e.g., door opens, temperature rises), the system sends notifications to the users (observers) who are subscribed to those events.   8. Auction Platforms   Description: Auction platforms, such as eBay, notify participants of new bids, bid price changes, or auction closing times.   Observer: Bidders participating in an auction.   Subject: The auction itself, including the item being sold.   How It Works: When users place bids on an item, they subscribe to updates. If a bid is placed or the auction is about to close, the platform (subject) notifies all active bidders.   9. Real-Time Traffic Updates   Description: Navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze notify users about traffic conditions, road closures, or new incidents along their route.   Observer: Drivers using the navigation system.   Subject: The route being taken by the user and the traffic data related to it.   How It Works: When drivers enter a route, they subscribe to real-time updates. The navigation system (subject) continuously monitors traffic data, and when there’s a change (e.g., a crash or road closure), it sends an update to users along the route.   10. Stock Market and Cryptocurrency Tracking   Description: Stock market applications such as Robinhood, E*TRADE, or cryptocurrency platforms like Coinbase notify users of price changes, market trends, or news affecting the stocks or cryptocurrencies they are following.   Observer: Investors or traders who are tracking specific financial assets.   Subject: The asset (e.g., a stock, cryptocurrency) being tracked.   How It Works: Users subscribe to specific stocks or cryptocurrencies. When the price or market trend changes, the system (subject) sends an update to all observers who have subscribed to the asset.   Conclusion   The Observer Design Pattern is invaluable when building systems that require real-time updates or notifications. Whether it’s used for social media notifications, real-time chat alerts, or system monitoring, the Observer pattern ensures that interested parties are notified as soon as an update occurs, improving responsiveness and interactivity.

        "title": "Real-Time vs Persistent Notifications: Choosing Between Observer Pattern and Databases",
        "excerpt":"In modern application development, delivering timely and accurate notifications is crucial to ensuring a seamless user experience. However, the mechanisms used to handle notifications can vary significantly depending on the application’s needs. Two commonly used approaches are the Observer Design Pattern for real-time notifications and databases for persistent notifications. This article delves into the differences between these methods, their practical use cases, and guidance on when to use each.   Understanding the Basics   The Observer Pattern  The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, and notifies them of any state changes. It is ideal for scenarios requiring real-time updates.   Key Characteristics:     Real-time notifications.   Decouples subjects and observers.   Flexible for dynamic subscription and unsubscription.   Example: Stock market applications notify registered users of price changes in real-time.   Database-Driven Notifications In contrast, databases are used to store notifications persistently. Applications periodically query the database or send notifications based on database triggers. This approach suits scenarios where users may not need immediate updates.   Key Characteristics:     Persistent data storage.   Reliable for offline access.   Better for historical data retrieval and reporting.   Example: Email notifications for account activity or billing reminders are generated and stored in a database before being sent to users.   When to Use the Observer Pattern   1. Real-Time Updates  When users need instant notifications about events, such as:     Stock price changes.   Live sports scores.   Real-time chat applications.   Why Use Observer Pattern?  The Observer pattern’s ability to push updates immediately ensures users receive information without delay.   2. Dynamic User Subscriptions  In scenarios where users frequently subscribe or unsubscribe to updates, such as:     News apps with customizable notifications.   Weather updates for specific locations.   Why Use Observer Pattern?  The pattern dynamically manages subscriptions without requiring extensive database operations.   3. Event-Driven Architectures  Applications with a high volume of events triggering actions benefit from the Observer pattern, such as:     IoT systems where sensors notify a central system of status changes.   Gaming systems providing real-time alerts.   When to Use Databases for Notifications   1. Historical Data and Persistent Storage  When notifications need to be stored for later reference or analytics, such as:     Banking apps saving transaction alerts.   E-commerce platforms storing order updates.   Why Use Databases?  Databases ensure data integrity and allow users to access past notifications at any time.   2. Offline Notifications  For applications where users might not always be connected, such as:     Travel apps storing booking confirmations.   Educational platforms saving course notifications.   Why Use Databases?  Databases allow notifications to persist until the user reconnects.   3. Bulk Notifications  When sending notifications to a large user base, such as:     Marketing emails or SMS campaigns.   System-wide announcements in corporate tools.   Why Use Databases?  Databases can batch-process notifications and ensure delivery to all recipients without overwhelming the system.   Combining Observer Pattern and Databases   Many applications blend both approaches for a balanced solution. For example:     A news app uses the Observer pattern to deliver breaking news in real-time and stores all notifications in a database for users to browse later.   A stock trading app pushes real-time price alerts using the Observer pattern while persisting all alerts in a database for audit purposes.   How It Works:     The Observer pattern handles immediate delivery.   A separate service persists the notifications in a database.   Users can access past notifications through database queries.   Advantages and Limitations   Observer Pattern  Advantages:     Provides instant updates.   Decouples components for better scalability.   Limitations:     May become complex with too many observers.   No built-in persistence for notifications.   Databases  Advantages:     Reliable for storing and retrieving data.   Ensures notifications are available even if users are offline.   Limitations:     Cannot deliver real-time updates without additional components like polling or WebSockets.   Choosing the Right Approach                  Criterion       Observer Pattern       Database                       Notification Speed       Real-time       Slightly delayed                 Persistence       Not built-in       Yes                 Offline Access       No       Yes                 Dynamic Subscriptions       Highly suitable       May require additional logic                 Use Case Examples       Stock alerts, live sports updates       Billing reminders, historical logs           Conclusion   The Observer pattern and databases serve distinct purposes in handling notifications. While the Observer pattern excels in real-time scenarios, databases provide reliability and persistence. Choosing the right approach—or combining both—depends on your application’s specific requirements. By understanding their strengths and limitations, you can design a notification system that meets both immediate and long-term needs effectively.

        "title": "Simplifying Complex Systems with the Facade Design Pattern in C#",
        "excerpt":"What is the Facade Design Pattern? Facade pronounce as fuh-sahd (/fəˈsɑːd/) is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or APIs. It acts as a unified interface that hides the complexities of the underlying system and provides a more straightforward way to interact with it.   Why use the Facade Design Pattern?     Simplifies complex systems by providing a more intuitive interface.   Decouples client code from implementation details.   Makes code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.   Promotes code reusability, modularity, and flexibility by encapsulating complex logic behind a simple interface.   Key components of the Facade Design Pattern:     Facade: The facade is a class that provides a simplified interface to the complex system. It delegates client requests to the appropriate subsystems.   Subsystem: These are the classes or components that make up the complex system. The facade delegates requests to these subsystems to perform specific tasks.   Client: The client is the code that interacts with the facade to access the system’s functionality. The client doesn’t need to know the details of the subsystems.

How it Works:     Subsystems handle specific operations like checking stocks, processing payments, scheduling deliveries, and sending notifications.   The OrderProcessingFacade encapsulates the interactions with these subsystems, providing a single entry point for order processing using the PlaceOrder method.   The client interacts with the OrderProcessingFacade to place an order, simplifying the complex workflow into a single method call.   Benefits of the Facade Design Pattern     Simplified Client Interaction: The client only needs to call one method.   Encapsulation of Complexity: Subsystems are hidden from the client.   Improved Maintainability: Changes to subsystems are isolated from the client.   Code Reusability: The Facade can be reused across different parts of the application.   Conclusion The Facade Design Pattern is an essential tool for developers to manage complex systems in a scalable and maintainable way. In our e-commerce example, it transformed a complicated order-processing workflow into a straightforward client interaction. By applying this pattern, you can make your applications more user-friendly and robust, whether you’re working on e-commerce platforms, multimedia systems, or any other domain.   Happy coding!

        "title": "Structuring Agile Work Using Epics, Stories, Tasks, DoR, DoD, Artifact and more",
        "excerpt":"   Introduction   In Agile product development, clearly defined Epics and User Stories are essential for delivering value efficiently, yet many teams face challenges like vague requirements, scope creep, and misaligned expectations. This guide provides a practical approach to defining, structuring, and using Epics and User Stories effectively, ensuring teams deliver the right value with clarity and speed. It covers how to define Epics with real examples, apply the INVEST framework for well-structured User Stories, and decompose Epics into coherent stories. You’ll learn how to use a reusable Story template, handle questions and requirement gaps, assign work across skills without losing user value, and apply the Definition of Ready and Definition of Done. By mastering these practices, teams can prevent scope drift, speed up estimation and planning, improve testability and acceptance alignment, enhance stakeholder transparency, and meet compliance requirements. All examples in this guide use a School Management System (SMS) domain, chosen for its multiple personas (admins, teachers, students, parents), regulated data (attendance, grades), and measurable outcomes (engagement, timeliness, accuracy), making it ideal for illustrating good Epic and Story design. This guide is structured to provide a snapshot of core concepts, followed by detailed sections on Epics, User Stories, acceptance criteria, and quality gates. It includes practical templates, checklists, and examples to help teams implement these practices effectively. Whether you are new to Agile or looking to refine your existing processes, this guide serves as a comprehensive resource for mastering Epics and User Stories in your product development lifecycle.

In Agile, an Epic is a large, high-level body of work that represents a significant deliverable or business objective, too big to complete in a single iteration, and therefore broken down into multiple smaller, related  User Stories.   It describes what needs to be achieved from a business perspective, without detailing the step-by-step tasks. Epics provide a broad context and vision, helping teams align on the “big picture” before diving into granular requirements.   Example (School Management System): Epic: “Enable online student attendance tracking for teachers” — This could later be decomposed into stories like “Mark daily attendance,” “Generate attendance reports,” and “Notify parents of absences.”   Would you like me to also give you a formal template for writing Epics so it stays consistent in your article?   Practical Steps to Define an Epic     Start with a clear business objective (outcome wording).   Express the problem in user or operational terms.   Draft success metrics (target + baseline if known).   Bound scope explicitly (what’s in / deferred).   List personas impacted.   Sketch capability slices (proto-stories).   Capture dependencies &amp; risks.   Define closure criteria (Epic DoD).   Epic Template                  Field       Purpose                TitleOutcome-oriented name     Problem / ContextCurrent pain, constraint, opportunity     Desired OutcomeQualitative value statement     Success MetricsQuantified targets (KPI / leading indicators)     Primary PersonasDirect beneficiaries     Secondary PersonasIndirect stakeholders     In ScopeCapabilities included now     Out of Scope / LaterDeferred elements to prevent creep     Capability SlicesSeed list of candidate stories     DependenciesExternal systems / other epics     Risks / AssumptionsKey uncertainties     Epic Definition of DoneClosure conditions (stories + metrics + docs)      Example Epic (School Management System)     Title: Automated Attendance Tracking &amp; Alerts   Problem: Teachers spend ~8 mins per class on manual attendance; late parent awareness drives support tickets.   Desired Outcome: Streamline attendance submission &amp; accelerate parent notification.   Success Metrics:            Median attendance submission time ≤ 2 minutes       ≥ 75% unexcused absence notifications &lt; 10 minutes from class start       Attendance-related support tickets −30%           In Scope: Roster pre-population, bulk marking, correction window, absence notification, audit log.   Out of Scope (Now): Historical analytics dashboard, absence appeals workflow.   Capability Slices: Pre-populated roster; bulk remaining absent; parent notification; late arrival adjustment; incomplete attendance dashboard; anomaly detection; audit export.   Dependencies: Enrollment API, Notification Service, Authentication Service.   Risks / Assumptions: Parent contact data completeness ≥ 95%; stable network in classrooms.   Epic DoD: All linked stories DoD met; metrics validated in staging baseline; documentation &amp; runbook updated; operations dashboard live.   Epic DoD Template   You can adapt this for any epic by filling in the specifics:   Epic Definition of Done Template      ✅ All linked user stories have met their respective DoD.   📊 Success metrics for the epic validated in staging (or pre-production) against baseline targets.   📄 User-facing documentation (release notes, help articles, FAQs) completed and approved.   🛠️ Technical documentation and runbooks updated for operations/support teams.   📈 Monitoring &amp; operational dashboards live and reviewed by stakeholders.   🔒 Security, performance, and compliance checks passed.   🚀 Epic-level UAT (User Acceptance Testing) completed with sign-off.   📅 Deployment plan created and communicated to all stakeholders.   Epic DoD Example – Automated Attendance Tracking &amp; Alerts   Epic DoD:      ✅ All linked user stories (roster pre-population, bulk absent marking, parent notifications, etc.) have passed their DoD including acceptance criteria, testing, and reviews.        📊 Success metrics validated in staging:              Median attendance submission time ≤ 2 minutes       ≥ 75% unexcused absence notifications sent in under 10 minutes       Attendance-related support tickets projected to drop by 30%           📄 Teacher guide updated with steps for using bulk marking and correction windows; parent FAQ for absence notifications published.   🛠️ Support team runbook updated for troubleshooting notification failures; escalation paths documented.   📈 Attendance operations dashboard live in production and verified by school admin team.   🔒 Privacy compliance checks passed for student data under education regulations.   🚀 UAT completed with school pilot group and sign-off obtained from product owner.   📅 Deployment plan created and communicated to all stakeholders.     Decomposing Epics into User Stories   Slicing Principles      Think vertical, not just technical: Each story should deliver something the user can actually see or use, instead of splitting only by backend, frontend, or database work.   One goal, one story: Focus each story on one user or system goal at a time.   Show real change: Every story should make something different in the product — whether it’s a new feature, a visible improvement, or a behavior change.   Separate the tricky bits: If exceptions or edge cases make a story too big, pull them out into their own smaller stories.   Keep them as independent as possible: Try to write stories that can be built and released in any order, using things like mocks or feature flags to avoid blockers.   Example User Stories (Based on the Epic Above)      View Class Roster: As a teacher, I can see a pre-filled list of my students so I can start marking attendance right away.   Bulk Mark Absences: As a teacher, I can mark all unmarked students as absent in one step to save time.   Notify Parents Automatically: When a student is marked absent, the system sends a notification to their parent.   Parent Sends Excuse: As a parent, I can submit an absence excuse directly from the notification I receive.   Late Arrival Adjustment: As a teacher, I can change a student’s status from absent to late within a set grace period.   Track Incomplete Attendance: As an admin, I can see a dashboard of classes with missing attendance records after 15 minutes of class start.   Flag Attendance Anomalies: The system alerts staff when a student has three unexcused absences in a row.   3.3 The INVEST Framework   The INVEST framework is a quick way to check if a user story is truly ready for development. It was created by Bill Wake and acts like a quality checklist so your stories are clear, valuable, and doable.   INVEST stands for:                  Letter       Meaning       Ask Yourself       Watch Out For       How to Fix                       I       Independent       Can this story be built without waiting for another?       Strong dependencies or shared acceptance criteria       Use mocks/stubs, or split/merge stories logically                 N       Negotiable       Is the focus on what to achieve, not how to build it?       Story forces a fixed design or tech choice       Move technical details to notes; reframe around the value                 V       Valuable       Will a user (or system) gain clear value immediately?       “Plumbing only” or invisible backend work       Add a thin, visible slice or combine with a related story                 E       Estimable       Can the team guess the effort with reasonable confidence?       External API unknowns, unclear scope       Do a research spike and capture assumptions                 S       Small       Can it be done comfortably within one sprint?       Multiple workflows bundled together       Break it into smaller stories by workflow or state                 T       Testable       Can we write clear pass/fail criteria?       Vague terms like “fast” or “secure”       Define measurable criteria and include negative cases           Definition of Ready rule: If a story fails any one of the INVEST checks, refine it before the sprint starts. A good story should pass all six.   Why is it required?     The INVEST framework helps:   Improve clarity of user stories.   Avoid ambiguity that leads to misunderstandings during development.   Enable better planning because stories are easier to estimate and prioritize.   Ensure quality so that stories are complete and testable.   When to use it?     During backlog refinement to check the quality of new or existing user stories.   Before development starts to confirm stories are ready for the team.   During sprint planning to ensure each story is truly “ready to work on.”   3.4 User Story Template   Title: A short, clear description of the goal (avoid technical jargon).   Story: As a [role/persona] I want [what they want to do] So that [why they want it / benefit / outcome]   Business Value / Metric Link: What business value does this story deliver? How does it link to measurable success or outcomes?   Background / Policy Context: Any relevant context, policies, or business rules that impact this story.   Acceptance Criteria:(Gherkin or bullets)      [First clear, measurable condition that must be true for the story to be accepted]   [Second condition]   [Negative or edge case]   Given … When … Then … (Gherkin format)   Or bullet points specifying expected behavior.   Non-Functional Requirements (Story-specific): Performance, usability, security, or other non-functional expectations specific to this story.   Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist:      Code developed and peer-reviewed   Unit tests written and passing   Integrated and tested in staging   Documentation updated (user + technical)   Meets performance/security requirements   Accepted by Product Owner   Data/Fields / Notes / Constraints:      Any design references, API contracts, or business rules that apply.   Important data elements involved and any validation rules.   Assumptions: Conditions or dependencies assumed true for this story.   Out of Scope:     What is explicitly excluded from this story’s scope?   Dependencies/Links:      List of other stories, systems, or services needed.   Other stories, features, APIs, or external services that this story depends on or relates to.   Security &amp; Privacy Notes: Any security, authorization, or privacy considerations relevant to this story.   Priority:      High / Medium / Low   3.5 Example Functional User Story (School Management System)   Title: Bulk Mark Remaining Students Absent   Story: As a teacher I want to mark all remaining unmarked students as absent with a single click So that I can save time during attendance and focus more on teaching   Business Value / Metric Link: Reduces attendance marking time, improving teacher efficiency and classroom management. Targets reducing manual entry time by at least 50%.   Background / Policy Context: Attendance must be recorded daily as per school policy. Teachers often have limited time; bulk marking helps streamline the process. The feature integrates with existing roster pre-population.   Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin or bullets):      Bulk mark button is visible only after attendance marking has started.   Clicking the bulk mark button marks all unmarked students as absent instantly.   A confirmation prompt appears before bulk marking is applied to prevent mistakes.   System logs bulk marking actions for audit purposes.   Non-Functional Requirements (Story-specific):      Feature must work on both desktop and mobile web interfaces.   Response time for bulk marking should be under 2 seconds for a class of up to 50 students.   Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist:      Code developed and peer-reviewed   Unit tests written and passing   Integrated and tested in staging environment   User documentation and help guides updated   Meets accessibility standards   Approved by Product Owner   Data / Fields &amp; Validation Notes:      Unmarked students identified by null attendance status.   Confirmation dialog requires explicit user acceptance before applying changes.   Assumptions:      The roster is pre-populated before attendance marking begins.   Teacher is authenticated and authorized to mark attendance.   Out of Scope:      Handling corrections or edits post bulk-marking (covered in separate stories).   Notifications to parents based on attendance changes.   Dependencies / Links:      Roster API for student lists   Authentication Service for user identity   Security &amp; Privacy Notes:      Only authorized teachers can perform bulk marking.   Audit logs must be securely stored and accessible to admins only.   Priority: High   3.5 Example Non-Functional User Story (School Management System)   Title: Secure Attendance Data Storage   Story: As a compliance officer I want all attendance data to be encrypted and access-controlled So that sensitive student information is protected and the system complies with privacy regulations   Business Value / Metric Link: Ensures compliance with data privacy laws such as GDPR and FERPA, reducing legal risks and building trust with parents and stakeholders.   Background / Policy Context: School data policies mandate strict handling of student records. Attendance data contains personally identifiable information (PII) that must be safeguarded.   Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin or bullets):      Attendance data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption.   Role-based access control restricts attendance data access to authorized users only (teachers, admins).   Audit logs track all access and modifications to attendance records.   System passes security audits with no critical vulnerabilities.   Non-Functional Requirements (Story-specific):      Encryption must comply with AES-256 standards or equivalent.   Access control should integrate with existing authentication and authorization systems.   Audit logs must be immutable and retained for at least 12 months.   Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist:      Encryption implemented and verified in staging environment   Access controls tested with positive and negative cases   Audit logging operational and verified   Security documentation updated   Approved by Security and Compliance teams   Data / Fields &amp; Validation Notes:      Sensitive fields: student name, attendance status, timestamps.   Validation of encryption keys rotation policy.   Assumptions:      Authentication system provides reliable user identity and roles.   Encryption libraries are up-to-date and maintained.   Out of Scope:      Encryption of other unrelated school data (handled separately).   User training on security policies.   Dependencies / Links:      Authentication Service   Logging/Audit Service   Security compliance standards (GDPR, FERPA)   Security &amp; Privacy Notes:      Compliance with all applicable data protection regulations.   Regular vulnerability scans and audits required.   Priority: High     Decomposing User Stories into Tasks and Subtasks   4.1 Why Decompose?   User stories define what needs to be done, but tasks and subtasks break down the how — the actual work units needed to implement the story. This helps with clear assignment, estimation, and tracking during development.   4.2 Definitions:      Task: A distinct piece of work needed to complete a user story. Usually assigned to a developer or team member.   Subtask: Smaller steps or checks within a task, often used to track progress or ensure quality.   4.3 Task Template   Title: Clear, concise description of the work to be done.   Description: Detailed explanation of what the task involves.   Assigned To: Person or role responsible.   Estimated Effort: Time estimate (hours/days).   Acceptance Criteria: Conditions for considering the task complete.   Dependencies: Other tasks or resources needed.   Status: Not started / In progress / Completed.   4.4 Subtask Template   Title: Brief description of the sub-step or check.   Description: Details on the subtask specifics.   Assigned To: Person or role.   Estimated Effort: Short time estimate.   Status: Not started / In progress / Completed.   4.5 Example Based on Secure Attendance Data Storage User Story   User Story Recap: Secure Attendance Data Storage — encrypt attendance data and enforce access control to protect student privacy.   Task 4.5.1: Implement Data Encryption   Description: Apply AES-256 encryption for attendance data at rest and ensure data in transit is encrypted via TLS.   Assigned To: Backend Developer   Estimated Effort: 2 days   Acceptance Criteria:      Data stored in the database is encrypted.   Data transmitted over network uses TLS.   Encryption keys management follows security guidelines.   Dependencies: Security library, Database encryption support   Task 4.5.1.1: Subtasks for Task 1      Subtask 1.1: Research AES-256 encryption library for .NET   Subtask 1.2: Implement encryption for attendance data before saving to database   Subtask 1.3: Implement decryption logic for retrieving data   Subtask 1.4: Configure TLS for all API endpoints handling attendance data   Subtask 1.5: Write unit tests to validate encryption and decryption   Task 4.5.2: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)   Description: Restrict access to attendance records based on user roles (Teacher, Admin, Compliance Officer).   Assigned To: Backend Developer   Estimated Effort: 1.5 days   Acceptance Criteria:      Unauthorized users cannot access attendance data.   Role permissions configurable and testable.   Access attempts are logged.   Dependencies: Authentication system, User roles definitions   Task 4.5.2.1: Subtasks for Task 2      Subtask 2.1: Define role permissions matrix   Subtask 2.2: Implement access control middleware   Subtask 2.3: Integrate with existing authentication service   Subtask 2.4: Write tests for authorized and unauthorized access   Subtask 2.5: Implement access logging   4.5.3 Task 3: Setup Audit Logging for Attendance Data Access   Description: Track all access and modifications to attendance data for compliance.   Assigned To: DevOps / Backend Developer   Estimated Effort: 1 day   Acceptance Criteria:      All access and change events are logged with timestamp and user ID.   Logs are immutable and stored securely.   Audit trail accessible for review.   Dependencies: Logging infrastructure, Security policies   Task 4.5.3.1: Subtasks for Task 3      Subtask 3.1: Configure audit logging service   Subtask 3.2: Instrument attendance data access points for logging   Subtask 3.3: Secure log storage setup   Subtask 3.4: Test audit log retrieval and integrity     Important Notes / Definition of Ready     5.1 Definition of Ready (DoR)   Definition of Ready (DoR) is a clear checklist or set of criteria that a user story (or work item) must meet before the team can confidently start working on it in a sprint or iteration. It ensures that the story is well-understood, actionable, and has everything needed to begin development without blockers.       5.1.1 What is Definition of Ready?      Purpose: To confirm that the user story is fully prepared for implementation.   Focus: Completeness of requirements, clarity, dependencies resolved, acceptance criteria defined, and any necessary designs or approvals available.        Benefits:              Prevents starting work on vague or incomplete stories.       Improves sprint planning accuracy.       Reduces mid-sprint interruptions for clarifications.               5.1.2 Where Should Definition of Ready Be Written?           In the Agile Tool or Backlog Management System: Usually, DoR is maintained alongside user stories in tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, or Trello. It can be part of the story’s description, a checklist, or a linked artifact.            Team Documentation or Wiki: Teams often document the standard DoR checklist in a shared space (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint) to align everyone on expectations.            In the Definition of Ready Policy or Team Working Agreement: Formal Agile teams might maintain a DoR policy document as part of their team norms or working agreements.           5.1.3 When is Definition of Ready (DoR) Used?           Before Sprint Planning: To decide which user stories are ready to be included in the upcoming sprint backlog.            During Backlog Refinement/Grooming: To review and prepare stories so they meet the readiness criteria before the sprint planning session.            Prior to Starting Development: Ensures the development team has enough clarity and resources to start work without delays.         5.1.4 Sample Definition of Ready (DoR) Checklist   Before a user story can be marked as “Ready” to work on, it should meet these criteria:      Story description is clear, complete, and understandable.   Acceptance criteria are well-defined and testable.   Story scope is small enough to be completed within a sprint.   Dependencies are identified and resolved or planned.   UX/UI designs, wireframes, or mockups are available if needed.   Non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance) are specified.   Business value or user impact is clear.   Product Owner has reviewed and approved the story.   Story is estimated or ready for estimation.   Necessary environments, tools, and data are accessible to the team.   Any risks or constraints are identified and communicated.       Maintaining Clarification Logs      Purpose: Capture all questions, clarifications, and answers related to user stories or epics.        Where to maintain:              In your project management tool (like Jira, Azure DevOps, or Trello), use a dedicated field or comment thread within the User Story or Epic.       Alternatively, maintain a shared document or spreadsheet (e.g., Confluence page or Google Sheet) linked from the story.                Content to include:              Date and time of the question       Person who raised the question       Detailed description of the question or gap       Clarification or answer provided       Status (open, resolved)       Link to relevant documentation if available               6.1 Capturing Change Tracking      Purpose: Track any scope changes or requirement updates discovered during development.        How to do it:              Change Request Process: Use your PM tool to raise change requests or create new user stories linked to the original.       Version Control: Update acceptance criteria and documentation with version history or timestamps.       Comments and Tags: Clearly tag stories or tasks with labels like “change-request” or “scope-update.”       Approval Workflow: Changes should ideally go through Product Owner or Stakeholder approval before implementation.           Why: This ensures transparency, auditability, and controlled scope management.       6.2 Accommodating Wireframes or Design Documents           Where to store:                       Use a centralized, accessible location such as:                      A Confluence page or SharePoint document library           A cloud storage folder (Google Drive, OneDrive)           Embedded attachments or links within the project management tool user story/task.                                How to associate:              Link design docs directly in the user story or task description.       Mention version numbers or dates to avoid confusion with older files.       Notify the development team about updates via comments or messaging channels.                Best Practices:              Keep wireframes/designs updated alongside requirements.       Include annotations or notes on design changes relevant to development.               6.3 Summary Workflow Example      Developer identifies a requirement gap or needs clarification → logs a question in the clarification log or comments on the story.   Product Owner or Business Analyst reviews and provides a clarification or decision → updates the clarification log.   If a change is required, a formal change request or additional user story is created, linked back to the original.   Any new or updated wireframes/design docs are uploaded to the shared repository and linked in the relevant story.   Team members are notified, and updates are tracked through the project management tool.       6.4 Tools that Support This Process      Jira: Comments, custom fields, attachments, linked issues, change logs.   Azure DevOps: Work item discussions, attachments, version control.   Confluence: Collaborative pages for clarifications and design documentation.   Slack/Microsoft Teams: Real-time notifications linked to tasks.       Tooling &amp; Traceability                  Purpose       Tool Type       Examples                       Managing Backlog &amp; Hierarchy       Work Tracking       Jira, Azure DevOps                 Documenting Decisions &amp; Knowledge       Wiki / Knowledge Base       Confluence, Notion                 Source Code &amp; Story Linking       Version Control System (VCS)       GitHub, GitLab (with commit referencing story IDs)                 Automating Builds &amp; Deployments       CI/CD Pipelines       GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines                 Creating &amp; Sharing Design Assets       UI/UX Design Tools       Figma                 Managing Test Cases &amp; Coverage       Test Management       Azure Test Plans, Xray, TestRail                 Monitoring Performance &amp; Logs       Observability Tools       Grafana, Elastic Stack, Datadog                 Checking Code Security &amp; Dependencies       Security Scanning       SonarQube, Dependabot           Certainly! Here’s a rewritten version of the traceability chain with a simple text-based diagram to illustrate the flow:     Traceability Chain: Objective / OKR → Epic → User Stories → Tasks → Commits / Tests → Build / Deploy → Telemetry → Metric Dashboard.

        "title": "Building a Professional Report Export API in ASP.NET Core: Excel, PDF & Word Generation with Template Architecture",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   In modern enterprise applications, the ability to export data into professional reports is essential for business operations, compliance, and decision-making. Whether it’s generating employee reports, financial statements, or operational dashboards, having a robust and scalable report generation system is crucial for any business application.   A Report Export API serves as a centralized solution that can transform your application data into professionally formatted documents across multiple formats. This approach not only ensures consistency in branding and styling but also provides flexibility for different use cases and user preferences.   This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to build a robust Report Export API in ASP.NET Core using a template-based architecture that supports Excel, PDF, and Word formats with professional branding and enterprise-ready features.   Why Report Export APIs are Important   Report export functionality is critical in enterprise applications for several reasons:      Business Intelligence: Enables stakeholders to analyze data offline and create presentations   Compliance &amp; Auditing: Provides documentation trails required by regulatory frameworks   Data Sharing: Facilitates sharing of structured data across different teams and departments   Professional Presentation: Creates polished, branded reports for client-facing communications   Backup &amp; Archival: Provides data snapshots for historical reference and backup purposes   Integration: Enables data exchange with external systems and third-party applications   User Experience: Gives users flexibility to consume data in their preferred format   What You’ll Learn   In this tutorial, you will learn how to:      Design a scalable template-based architecture for report generation   Implement professional Excel reports with EPPlus   Create PDF documents with iTextSharp   Generate Word documents with OpenXML   Add company branding and professional styling   Implement dependency injection for better testability   Create reusable templates for different data types   Build RESTful API endpoints for report downloads   Handle multiple export formats efficiently   Tools and Technology Used      ASP.NET Core 8.0: Core framework for building the Web API   Entity Framework Core: Data access and in-memory database for demo   EPPlus 7.5.1: Excel file generation and manipulation   iTextSharp.LGPLv2.Core 3.4.22: PDF document generation   DocumentFormat.OpenXml 3.2.0: Word document generation   Swagger/OpenAPI: API documentation and testing   Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code: Development environment   C# 12: Programming language   SQL Server (optional): Production database   Architecture Overview   Our Report Export API follows a clean, template-based architecture that separates concerns and ensures maintainability:   ExportReportAPI/ ├── Controllers/ │   └── EmployeesController.cs          # API endpoints ├── Data/ │   ├── ApplicationDbContext.cs         # Database context │   └── DatabaseSeeder.cs              # Sample data ├── Generator/ │   ├── Interfaces/ │   │   ├── IReportTemplate.cs          # Base template interface │   │   ├── IExcelTemplate.cs           # Excel template interface │   │   ├── IPDFTemplate.cs             # PDF template interface │   │   └── IWordTemplate.cs            # Word template interface │   └── Templates/ │       ├── ExcelTemplate.cs            # Excel implementation │       ├── PDFTemplate.cs              # PDF implementation │       └── WordTemplate.cs             # Word implementation ├── Models/ │   ├── Employee.cs                     # Data model │   └── ExportResult.cs                 # Export result wrapper ├── Services/ │   ├── IExportService.cs              # Export service interface │   └── ExportService.cs               # Export service implementation ├── images/ │   └── mahedeedotnet_log.png          # Company logo └── Program.cs                         # Application configuration   Key Features      Template-Based Architecture: Reusable templates for different formats   Professional Branding: Company logo, headers, and consistent styling   Dependency Injection: Loosely coupled, testable components   Multiple Export Formats: Excel, PDF, and Word support   RESTful API Design: Clean, intuitive endpoints   Enterprise-Ready: Professional formatting and error handling     Step 1: Create ASP.NET Core Web API Project   First, create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project:   Option 1: Using Visual Studio     Open Visual Studio 2022   Click “Create a new project”   Select “ASP.NET Core Web API”   Name your project “ExportReportAPI”   Choose “.NET 8.0” as the target framework   Enable “Use controllers” and “Enable OpenAPI support”   Option 2: Using .NET CLI   dotnet new webapi -n ExportReportAPI cd ExportReportAPI     Step 2: Install Required NuGet Packages   Install the necessary NuGet packages for report generation:   &lt;PackageReference Include=\"DocumentFormat.OpenXml\" Version=\"3.2.0\" /&gt;

        }     } }     Step 9: Configure Application Startup   Configure dependency injection and application settings.   Program.cs   using ExportReportAPI.Data; using ExportReportAPI.Generator.Interfaces; using ExportReportAPI.Generator.Templates; using ExportReportAPI.Models; using ExportReportAPI.Services; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using System.Reflection;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container. builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;     options.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"EmployeeDb\"));  // Register template services builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IExcelTemplate, ExcelTemplate&gt;(); builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IPDFTemplate, PDFTemplate&gt;(); builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IWordTemplate, WordTemplate&gt;();  // Register main export service builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IExportService, ExportService&gt;();  builder.Services.AddControllers();  // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer(); builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt; {     c.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new() {          Title = \"Export Report API\",          Version = \"v1\",         Description = \"ASP.NET Core Web API for exporting reports in multiple formats (Excel, PDF, Word)\"     });          // Include XML comments for better documentation     var xmlFile = $\"{Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name}.xml\";     var xmlPath = Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, xmlFile);     if (File.Exists(xmlPath))     {         c.IncludeXmlComments(xmlPath);     } });  // Configure EPPlus license OfficeOpenXml.ExcelPackage.LicenseContext = OfficeOpenXml.LicenseContext.NonCommercial;  var app = builder.Build();  // Seed database with sample data using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope()) {     var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;();     DatabaseSeeder.SeedDatabase(context); }  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline. if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {     app.UseSwagger();     app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;     {         c.SwaggerEndpoint(\"/swagger/v1/swagger.json\", \"Export Report API V1\");         c.RoutePrefix = string.Empty; // Set Swagger UI at the app's root     }); }  app.UseHttpsRedirection();  app.UseAuthorization();  app.MapControllers();  app.Run();     Step 10: Update Project Configuration   Update the project file to include proper settings and logo copying.   ExportReportAPI.csproj   &lt;Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"&gt;    &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;     &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net8.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;     &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;     &lt;ImplicitUsings&gt;enable&lt;/ImplicitUsings&gt;     &lt;GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;true&lt;/GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;     &lt;NoWarn&gt;$(NoWarn);1591&lt;/NoWarn&gt;   &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;     &lt;PackageReference Include=\"DocumentFormat.OpenXml\" Version=\"3.2.0\" /&gt;     &lt;PackageReference Include=\"EPPlus\" Version=\"7.5.1\" /&gt;     &lt;PackageReference Include=\"iTextSharp.LGPLv2.Core\" Version=\"3.4.22\" /&gt;     &lt;PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory\" Version=\"8.0.11\" /&gt;     &lt;PackageReference Include=\"Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\" Version=\"6.6.2\" /&gt;   &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;     &lt;Content Include=\"images\\**\"&gt;       &lt;CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;PreserveNewest&lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory&gt;     &lt;/Content&gt;   &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;  &lt;/Project&gt;     Step 11: Add Company Logo      Create an images folder in your project root   Add your company logo file (e.g., mahedeedotnet_log.png)   The logo will be automatically included in the reports   Folder Structure:  ExportReportAPI/ ├── images/ │   └── mahedeedotnet_log.png     Step 12: Run and Test the Application      Build and Run the Application:   dotnet build dotnet run      Access Swagger UI:            Open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:7xxx (port will vary)       You’ll see the Swagger UI with all available endpoints           Test Export Endpoints:            Excel Export: GET /api/employees/export/excel       PDF Export: GET /api/employees/export/pdf       Word Export: GET /api/employees/export/word           Test with Sample Data:            The application automatically seeds sample employee data       You can also add/modify employees through the CRUD endpoints             Key Features Implemented   1.

        "excerpt":"Introduction   Running the same code across environments demands clear configuration boundaries, safe database migrations, and repeatable tests. In this comprehensive step-by-step guide, you’ll develop and configure an ASP.NET Core Web API project from scratch to work consistently in Development, QA, and Production using ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and SQL Server. At the end of this guide, you’ll have a production-ready HRM (Human Resource Management) API with automated testing workflows for multiple environments.   Why it is important?     Environment parity reduces “works on my machine” issues.   Safer deployments with gated migrations and smoke tests.   Clean separation of secrets and settings for Dev/QA/Prod.   Faster troubleshooting with predictable diagnostics and seed data.   Production-ready architecture with proper testing infrastructure.   Tools and Technology Used     .NET 9 SDK   ASP.NET Core Web API   C#   Entity Framework Core 9 (SQL Server)   SQL Server (LocalDB, Express, or full version)   xUnit (testing framework)   PowerShell (automation scripts)   Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code   Implementation:   Step 1: Prepare Development Environment   Option A — Local SQL Server Installation: Install SQL Server, or use LocalDB. Ensure SQL Server is accessible with your credentials.   Option B — Docker SQL Server (Windows PowerShell): If you don’t have SQL Server installed, use Docker to run a SQL Server container:   # Pull and run SQL Server 2022 in Docker docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest docker run -e \"ACCEPT_EULA=Y\" -e \"SA_PASSWORD=YourPassword123!\" -p 1433:1433 --name sql2022 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest  # Verify connection sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P \"YourPassword123!\" -Q \"SELECT @@VERSION\"   Verify Prerequisites:  # Check .NET 9 SDK dotnet --version # Expected: 9.0.x  # Test SQL Server connection sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q \"SELECT @@VERSION\"  # Check PowerShell version $PSVersionTable.PSVersion   Step 2: Create Project Structure from Scratch      Create the solution and project structure using the following commands:   # Create solution structure mkdir multi-env-app cd multi-env-app mkdir src, doc cd src mkdir HRM cd HRM  # Create solution and Web API project dotnet new sln -n HRM dotnet new webapi -n HRM.API --framework net9.0 dotnet sln add HRM.API/HRM.API.csproj  # Navigate to API project and install packages cd HRM.API dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --version 9.0.0 dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools --version 9.0.0 dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 9.0.0 dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi --version 9.0.0 dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore --version 6.8.1  # Create project folders mkdir Controllers, Models, DTOs, Services, Data, Migrations      You can use visual studio to create the solution and project structure if you prefer a GUI.

Create environment-specific configuration files:   Create appsettings.json (Production base):  {   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=prod-server;Database=HRM_Prod;User Id=hrm_user;Password=secure_prod_password;TrustServerCertificate=true;Encrypt=true;\"   },   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Warning\",       \"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\": \"Warning\"     }   },   \"AllowedHosts\": \"*\",   \"ApiSettings\": {     \"Version\": \"v1\",     \"Title\": \"HRM API - Production\",     \"EnableSwagger\": false,     \"EnableDetailedErrors\": false   } }   Create appsettings.Development.json:  {   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=localhost;Database=HRM_DEV;User Id=sa;Password=YourPassword123!;TrustServerCertificate=true;\"   },   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Debug\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command\": \"Information\"     }   },   \"ApiSettings\": {     \"Version\": \"v1\",     \"Title\": \"HRM API - Development\",     \"EnableSwagger\": true,     \"EnableDetailedErrors\": true   } }   Create appsettings.QA.json:  {   \"ConnectionStrings\": {     \"DefaultConnection\": \"Server=localhost;Database=HRM_QA;User Id=sa;Password=YourPassword123!;TrustServerCertificate=true;\"   },   \"Logging\": {     \"LogLevel\": {       \"Default\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\": \"Information\",       \"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\": \"Information\"     }   },   \"ApiSettings\": {     \"Version\": \"v1\",     \"Title\": \"HRM API - QA Environment\",     \"EnableSwagger\": true,     \"EnableDetailedErrors\": true   } }   Configure Multiple Launch Profiles:   Update Properties/launchSettings.json:  {   \"profiles\": {     \"development\": {       \"commandName\": \"Project\",       \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7285;http://localhost:5152\",       \"launchBrowser\": true,       \"launchUrl\": \"swagger\",       \"environmentVariables\": {         \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"       }     },     \"qa\": {       \"commandName\": \"Project\",       \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7286;http://localhost:5153\",       \"launchBrowser\": true,       \"launchUrl\": \"swagger\",       \"environmentVariables\": {         \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"QA\"       }     },     \"production\": {       \"commandName\": \"Project\",       \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7287;http://localhost:5154\",       \"launchBrowser\": false,       \"environmentVariables\": {         \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Production\"       }     }   } }   Set environment when running:     Run the following command in PowerShell to set the environment variable:     $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Development\"   # or \"QA\", \"Production\"           Step 5: Create Business Logic Services   Create service interfaces and implementations (key files):   Create Services/IDepartmentService.cs:  using HRM.API.DTOs;  namespace HRM.API.Services {     public interface IDepartmentService     {         Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;DepartmentDto&gt;&gt; GetAllDepartmentsAsync();         Task&lt;DepartmentDto?&gt; GetDepartmentByIdAsync(int id);         Task&lt;DepartmentDto&gt; CreateDepartmentAsync(CreateDepartmentDto createDepartmentDto);         Task&lt;bool&gt; DeleteDepartmentAsync(int id);         Task&lt;bool&gt; DepartmentExistsAsync(int id);     } }   Create Services/DepartmentService.cs (implementing business logic with EF Core operations).   Step 6: Create API Controllers   Create Controllers/DepartmentsController.cs:  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; using HRM.API.DTOs; using HRM.API.Services;  namespace HRM.API.Controllers {     [ApiController]     [Route(\"api/[controller]\")]     [Produces(\"application/json\")]     public class DepartmentsController : ControllerBase     {         private readonly IDepartmentService _departmentService;          public DepartmentsController(IDepartmentService departmentService)         {             _departmentService = departmentService;         }          [HttpGet]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;DepartmentDto&gt;&gt;&gt; GetDepartments()         {             var departments = await _departmentService.GetAllDepartmentsAsync();             return Ok(departments);         }          [HttpGet(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;DepartmentDto&gt;&gt; GetDepartment(int id)         {             var department = await _departmentService.GetDepartmentByIdAsync(id);             if (department == null)                 return NotFound($\"Department with ID {id} not found.\");              return Ok(department);         }          [HttpPost]         public async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;DepartmentDto&gt;&gt; CreateDepartment(CreateDepartmentDto createDepartmentDto)         {             if (!ModelState.IsValid)                 return BadRequest(ModelState);              var department = await _departmentService.CreateDepartmentAsync(createDepartmentDto);             return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetDepartment), new { id = department.DepartmentId }, department);         }          [HttpDelete(\"{id}\")]         public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteDepartment(int id)         {             var result = await _departmentService.DeleteDepartmentAsync(id);             if (!result)                 return NotFound($\"Department with ID {id} not found.\");              return NoContent();         }     } }   Step 7: Configure Program.cs for Multi-Environment Support   Update Program.cs:  using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using HRM.API.Data; using HRM.API.Services;  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  // Add services to the container builder.Services.AddControllers();  // Configure Entity Framework with environment-specific connection string builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;HrmDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;     options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\")));  // Register business services for dependency injection builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IDepartmentService, DepartmentService&gt;(); builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;IEmployeeService, EmployeeService&gt;();  // Configure API documentation builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();  // Conditionally add Swagger based on environment configuration var apiSettings = builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"ApiSettings\"); if (apiSettings.GetValue&lt;bool&gt;(\"EnableSwagger\")) {     builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;     {         c.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new()          {              Title = apiSettings.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(\"Title\"),              Version = apiSettings.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(\"Version\")          });     }); }  var app = builder.Build();  // Configure the HTTP request pipeline based on environment if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment() || app.Environment.EnvironmentName == \"QA\") {     if (apiSettings.GetValue&lt;bool&gt;(\"EnableSwagger\"))     {         app.UseSwagger();         app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;         {             c.SwaggerEndpoint(\"/swagger/v1/swagger.json\", apiSettings.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(\"Title\"));         });     } }  app.UseHttpsRedirection(); app.UseAuthorization(); app.MapControllers();  // Ensure database is created (for development/demo purposes) using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope()) {     var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;HrmDbContext&gt;();     context.Database.EnsureCreated(); }  app.Run();   Note: EnsureCreated() is used for demo purposes. For production, use Database.Migrate() and controlled migrations.   Step 8: Create and Apply Database Migrations   Navigate to the API project and create/apply migrations for each environment:   cd d:/Projects/GitHub/rnd/projects/in-progress/multi-env-app/src/HRM/HRM.API  # Create initial migration dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate  # Apply migration to Development database $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Development\" dotnet ef database update  # Apply migration to QA database $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"QA\" dotnet ef database update  # Apply migration to Production database (when ready) $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Production\" dotnet ef database update   When models change, add new migrations:  $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Development\" dotnet ef migrations add AddNewField dotnet ef database update   Verify Database Creation: After running migrations, you should have three separate databases:     HRM_DEV (Development)   HRM_QA (QA)   HRM_Prod (Production)   Each database contains the seeded data from HrmDbContext, providing consistent test data across environments.   Step 9: Run and Test the API Across Environments   cd d:/Projects/GitHub/rnd/projects/in-progress/multi-env-app/src/HRM/HRM.API  # Run in Development with Swagger UI $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Development\" dotnet run --launch-profile development # Access: http://localhost:5152/swagger  # Run in QA environment $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"QA\" dotnet run --launch-profile qa # Access: http://localhost:5153/swagger  # Run in Production mode (no Swagger) $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Production\" dotnet run --launch-profile production # Access: http://localhost:5154/api/departments   Environment-Specific Features:     Development: Swagger UI enabled, detailed logging, debug information   QA: Swagger UI enabled, moderate logging, similar to production but with testing features   Production: Swagger disabled, minimal logging, optimized for performance   Run the application for different environments using Visual Studio     Select the desired profile (development, qa, production) from the debug dropdown and run.   Step 10: API Testing and Validation   Manual Testing with PowerShell:  # Test Development environment $env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Development\" # Start the API in another terminal: dotnet run --launch-profile development  # Get all departments Invoke-RestMethod -Method GET -Uri \"http://localhost:5152/api/departments\" | ConvertTo-Json  # Get all employees Invoke-RestMethod -Method GET -Uri \"http://localhost:5152/api/employees\" | ConvertTo-Json  # Create a new department $newDept = @{     name = \"Research &amp; Development\"     description = \"Innovation and product development\"     isActive = $true } | ConvertTo-Json  Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri \"http://localhost:5152/api/departments\" -ContentType \"application/json\" -Body $newDept  # Create a new employee $newEmployee = @{     firstName = \"John\"     lastName = \"Doe\"     email = \"john.doe@company.com\"     phoneNumber = \"+1-555-1234\"     hireDate = \"2024-10-12T00:00:00\"     salary = 75000.00     departmentId = 2 } | ConvertTo-Json  Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri \"http://localhost:5152/api/employees\" -ContentType \"application/json\" -Body $newEmployee   Using VS Code REST Client: Create test-requests.http in the HRM.API project:  ### Get all departments GET http://localhost:5152/api/departments Accept: application/json  ### Get all employees GET http://localhost:5152/api/employees Accept: application/json  ### Create new department POST http://localhost:5152/api/departments Content-Type: application/json  {   \"name\": \"Quality Assurance\",   \"description\": \"Software testing and quality control\",   \"isActive\": true }  ### Create new employee POST http://localhost:5152/api/employees Content-Type: application/json  {   \"firstName\": \"Jane\",   \"lastName\": \"Smith\",   \"email\": \"jane.smith@company.com\",   \"phoneNumber\": \"+1-555-5678\",   \"hireDate\": \"2024-10-12T00:00:00\",   \"salary\": 80000.00,   \"departmentId\": 1 }   Step 11: Create Automated Testing Infrastructure   Create Test Project:  # Navigate to HRM solution directory cd .. # from HRM.API to HRM  # Create test project dotnet new xunit -n HRM.Tests dotnet sln add HRM.Tests/HRM.Tests.csproj  # Add test packages and project reference cd HRM.Tests dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing --version 9.0.0 dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory --version 9.0.0 dotnet add package FluentAssertions --version 6.12.0 dotnet add reference ../HRM.API/HRM.API.csproj   Create Integration Test Infrastructure:   Create HRM.Tests/TestWebApplicationFactory.cs:  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; using HRM.API.Data;  namespace HRM.Tests {     public class TestWebApplicationFactory&lt;TStartup&gt; : WebApplicationFactory&lt;TStartup&gt; where TStartup : class     {         protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)         {             builder.ConfigureServices(services =&gt;             {                 // Remove the real database context                 var descriptor = services.SingleOrDefault(                     d =&gt; d.ServiceType == typeof(DbContextOptions&lt;HrmDbContext&gt;));                 if (descriptor != null)                 {                     services.Remove(descriptor);                 }                  // Add in-memory database for testing                 services.AddDbContext&lt;HrmDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;                 {                     options.UseInMemoryDatabase(\"InMemoryDbForTesting\");                 });                  // Build the service provider and create the database                 var sp = services.BuildServiceProvider();                 using (var scope = sp.CreateScope())                 {                     var scopedServices = scope.ServiceProvider;                     var db = scopedServices.GetRequiredService&lt;HrmDbContext&gt;();                     var logger = scopedServices.GetRequiredService&lt;ILogger&lt;TestWebApplicationFactory&lt;TStartup&gt;&gt;&gt;();                      // Ensure the database is created                     db.Database.EnsureCreated();                      try                     {                         // Seed test data if needed                         SeedTestData(db);                     }                     catch (Exception ex)                     {                         logger.LogError(ex, \"An error occurred seeding the database with test messages.

        "excerpt":"   Introduction   Binary tree traversal algorithms are fundamental techniques in computer science that allow us to systematically visit every node in a binary tree exactly once. These algorithms form the backbone of many tree-based operations and are essential for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms.   🌳 What makes tree traversal special?   Unlike linear data structures (arrays, linked lists), trees have multiple paths to reach different nodes, making the order of visitation crucial for different applications.   In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore:     ✅ Four major traversal algorithms with step-by-step explanations   🔧 Complete Java implementations ready to use   📊 Performance analysis and complexity comparisons   🎯 Real-world applications and use cases   💡 Best practices and optimization techniques     Table of Contents      What is Tree Traversal?   Types of Tree Traversal   Depth-First Traversals            Preorder Traversal       Inorder Traversal       Postorder Traversal           Breadth-First Traversal   Complete Implementation   Performance Analysis   Practical Applications   Comparison Guide   Advanced Techniques   Conclusion     What is Tree Traversal?   Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once in a systematic way. Think of it as taking a tour through a family tree or organizational chart - you want to visit everyone, but the order matters depending on your purpose.   Key Characteristics:     📍 Systematic: Follows a consistent, predictable pattern   ✅ Complete: Visits every node exactly once   🔄 Ordered: The sequence of visits matters for different applications   ⚡ Efficient: Optimized for specific use cases   Why Traversal Order Matters:            Different traversal orders serve different purposes: • Top-down: CEO → Managers → Employees (authority flow) • Bottom-up: Employees → Managers → CEO (reporting flow) • Left-to-right: Process departments in sequence     Types of Tree Traversal   Tree traversal algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main types:   🔽 1. Depth-First Traversal (DFS)  Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.                  Type       Order       Best For                       Preorder       Root → Left → Right       Tree copying, prefix expressions                 Inorder       Left → Root → Right       BST sorted output, expression trees                 Postorder       Left → Right → Root       Tree deletion, postfix expressions           🔄 2. Breadth-First Traversal (BFS)  Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level.                  Type       Order       Best For                       Level Order       Level by level, left to right       Tree printing, shortest path, BFS             Depth-First Traversals   Depth-first traversals use a recursive approach (or stack-based iterative approach) and differ in the order they visit the current node relative to its children.   Example Tree for All Demonstrations:             Preorder Traversal  Preorder traversal is a type of depth-first traversal where the current node is processed first, then the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.   Order: Root → Left Subtree → Right Subtree   Think of it as: “Visit me first, then explore my left side, then my right side”   🔧 Algorithm:  preorder(node):     if node is not null:         visit(node)           // ✅ Process current node FIRST         preorder(node.left)   // 🔄 Traverse left subtree         preorder(node.right)  // 🔄 Traverse right subtree   Preorder Result: A → B → D → G → E → C → F   Use Cases &amp; Applications:   1. Tree Copying &amp; Cloning  Purpose: Creating an exact duplicate of a tree structure  Why Preorder: Parent nodes must be created before their children to maintain proper structure  Example:     Input Tree: Company hierarchy with CEO → Managers → Employees   Process: Clone CEO first, then managers under CEO, then employees under each manager   Output: Identical organizational structure in a backup system   2. Prefix Expression Evaluation  Purpose: Processing mathematical expressions in prefix notation (Polish notation)  Why Preorder: Operators appear before operands, matching preorder’s root-first approach  Example:     Input: + * 3 4 5 (meaning: (3 × 4) + 5)   Process: Process ‘+’ operator first, then evaluate ‘* 3 4’, then add ‘5’   Output: Result = 17   3. Directory &amp; File System Traversal  Purpose: Listing folder hierarchies with directories appearing before their contents  Why Preorder: Folders must be displayed before showing what’s inside them  Example:     Input: Project folder structure   Process:     📁 src/   📁 main/     📁 java/       📄 Main.java       📄 Utils.java   📁 test/     📄 TestMain.java           Output: Hierarchical directory listing where folders appear before their files   4. Tree Serialization &amp; Storage  Purpose: Converting tree structure to a linear format for storage or transmission  Why Preorder: Root-first order ensures proper reconstruction sequence  Example:     Input Tree: Binary tree with nodes [A, B, C, D, E]   Process: Serialize in preorder sequence with null markers   Output: \"A,B,D,null,null,E,null,null,C,null,null\"   5. HTML/XML Document Processing  Purpose: Processing nested document structures where parent elements contain children  Why Preorder: Parent tags must be opened before processing child elements  Example:     Input: HTML structure &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   Process: Process &lt;div&gt; first, then &lt;p&gt;, then &lt;span&gt;   Output: Properly rendered HTML with correct nesting   6. Game Scene Graph Rendering  Purpose: Rendering 3D scenes where parent transformations affect children  Why Preorder: Parent transformations must be applied before children inherit them  Example:     Input: Character → Body → Arm → Hand hierarchy   Process: Apply character position first, then body rotation, then arm movement   Output: Correctly transformed 3D model where hand moves with arm and body   7. Organizational Chart Generation  Purpose: Creating visual representations of company or project hierarchies  Why Preorder: Management levels must be established before showing subordinates  Example:     Input: Employee database with reporting relationships   Process: Display CEO first, then VPs, then managers, then individual contributors   Output:     CEO: John Smith   VP Engineering: Jane Doe     Senior Developer: Bob Wilson     Junior Developer: Alice Brown   VP Marketing: Mike Johnson           8. Dependency Analysis &amp; Build Systems  Purpose: Identifying what components depend on others in software projects  Why Preorder: Dependencies must be identified before they can be resolved  Example:     Input: Module dependency tree where App → Database → Logger → FileSystem   Process: Map dependencies starting from root application   Output: Dependency list showing what needs to be built first: [FileSystem, Logger, Database, App]   ⏱️ Complexity:     Time: O(n) - visits each node once   Space: O(h) - where h is tree height (recursion stack)     Inorder Traversal   Inorder traversal is a type of depth-first traversal where the left subtree is processed first, then the current node, followed by the right subtree.   Order: Left Subtree → Root → Right Subtree   Think of it as: “Explore my left side first, then visit me, then my right side”   Algorithm:   inorder(node):     if node is not null:         inorder(node.left)    // 🔄 Traverse left subtree FIRST         visit(node)           // ✅ Process current node         inorder(node.right)   // 🔄 Traverse right subtree   Inorder Result: G → D → B → E → A → C → F   Use Cases &amp; Applications:   1. Binary Search Tree (BST) Data Retrieval  Purpose: Extracting data from BSTs in sorted order without additional sorting  Why Inorder: BST property ensures left &lt; root &lt; right, making inorder naturally sorted  Example:     Input BST: Employee database with salary nodes [50K, 30K, 70K, 25K, 35K, 60K, 80K]   Process: Traverse left subtree, visit root, traverse right subtree   Output: Sorted salary list [25K, 30K, 35K, 50K, 60K, 70K, 80K]   2. Mathematical Expression Trees &amp; Infix Conversion  Purpose: Converting expression trees to human-readable infix notation  Why Inorder: Matches natural mathematical notation where operators appear between operands  Example:     Input: Expression tree representing ((3 + 5) * 2)   Process: Traverse left operand, visit operator, traverse right operand   Output: “((3 + 5) * 2)” - properly parenthesized infix expression   3. Threaded Binary Tree Construction  Purpose: Creating threading pointers for efficient traversal without recursion or stack  Why Inorder: Threading follows inorder sequence to connect nodes  Example:     Input: Regular binary tree with nodes [A, B, C, D, E]   Process: Connect each node’s right pointer to its inorder successor when right child is null   Output: Threaded tree allowing O(1) space traversal   4. Binary Search Tree Validation  Purpose: Verifying if a binary tree satisfies BST properties  Why Inorder: BST must produce strictly ascending sequence in inorder traversal  Example:     Input Tree 1: [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 12, 18] → Inorder: [3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18] ✅ Valid BST   Input Tree 2: [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 12, 6] → Inorder: [3, 5, 7, 10, 6, 12, 15] ❌ Invalid (6 &lt; 10)   Output: Boolean validation result based on sequence ordering   5. Range Query Processing  Purpose: Finding all values within a specific range in sorted trees  Why Inorder: Natural sorted order allows efficient range processing  Example:     Input: Customer age BST with range query [25, 35]   Process: Traverse inorder, collect nodes where 25 ≤ age ≤ 35   Output: All customers aged 25-35 in sorted order: [26, 28, 31, 34, 35]   6. Database Index Scanning  Purpose: Efficient sequential access to database records in sorted order  Why Inorder: Database B-tree indexes use inorder for range scans  Example:     Input: Product database with price index   Process: Inorder scan from $10 to $50 price range   Output: All products in price order: [$12 Widget, $25 Gadget, $45 Tool]   7. Median &amp; Statistical Operations  Purpose: Finding median, percentiles, and order statistics in BSTs  Why Inorder: Sorted sequence makes statistical calculations straightforward  Example:     Input: Test scores BST [85, 72, 93, 68, 78, 90, 96]   Process: Inorder traversal gives sorted scores   Output: Median = 85 (middle element), 75th percentile = 93   8. Tree Serialization for Reconstruction  Purpose: Saving BST structure in a way that preserves sorting properties  Why Inorder: Combined with preorder/postorder enables efficient BST reconstruction  Example:     Input: BST with nodes [50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]   Process: Store inorder sequence for sorted data, preorder for structure   Output: Inorder: [20,30,40,50,60,70,80] + Preorder: [50,30,20,40,70,60,80]   9. Sorted Data Processing  Purpose: Processing data that needs to maintain sorted order during operations  Why Inorder: Eliminates need for separate sorting step  Example:     Input: Stock price BST updated throughout trading day   Process: Generate end-of-day report using inorder traversal   Output: Price movement report in ascending order: [AAPL:$150, GOOGL:$175, MSFT:$200]   10. Successor/Predecessor Finding  Purpose: Locating next/previous elements in sorted order  Why Inorder: Natural sequence makes finding adjacent elements efficient  Example:     Input: Dictionary BST, find word after “program”   Process: Use inorder sequence to identify next word   Output: Successor of “program” is “programming”   ⭐ Special Property:  For Binary Search Trees, inorder traversal always produces elements in sorted (ascending) order.   ⏱️ Complexity:     Time: O(n)   Space: O(h)     Postorder Traversal   Postorder traversal is a type of depth-first traversal where the left subtree is processed first, then the right subtree, followed by the current node (root).   Order: Left Subtree → Right Subtree → Root   Think of it as: “Handle my children first, then deal with me”   🔧 Algorithm:  postorder(node):     if node is not null:         postorder(node.left)   // 🔄 Traverse left subtree FIRST         postorder(node.right)  // 🔄 Traverse right subtree SECOND         visit(node)            // ✅ Process current node LAST   Postorder Result: G → D → E → B → F → C → A   Use Cases &amp; Applications:   1. Tree Deletion &amp; Memory Cleanup  Purpose: Safely deleting tree nodes by removing children before parents  Why Postorder: Children must be deleted before parent to avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers. Dangling pointers mean references to nodes that have already been deleted, which can lead to errors or crashes if accessed later.  Example:     Input Tree: File system tree with folders and files   Process: Delete all files first, then empty folders, finally root folder   Output: Clean memory deallocation: Files → Subfolders → Main folder → Root   2. Postfix Expression Evaluation (Reverse Polish Notation)  Purpose: Evaluating mathematical expressions in postfix notation  Why Postorder: Operands must be processed before operators, matching postfix structure  Example:     Input: Expression tree for “3 4 + 2 *” (meaning: (3 + 4) × 2)   Process: Calculate 3, then 4, then +, then 2, finally *   Output: Result = 14 (first 3+4=7, then 7×2=14)   3. Directory Size Calculation  Purpose: Computing folder sizes by calculating subfolder sizes first  Why Postorder: Must know children sizes before calculating parent size  Example:     Input: Project folder with subfolders   Process:     📄 file1.txt (2KB)  📄 file2.java (5KB) 📁 src/ = 7KB (calculated after files) 📁 project/ = 7KB (calculated after src/)           Output: Total project size: 7KB   4. Dependency Resolution &amp; Build Systems  Purpose: Processing dependencies before the components that depend on them  Why Postorder: Dependencies must be built/resolved before their dependents  Example:     Input: Software modules: App depends on Database, Database depends on Logger   Process: Build Logger first, then Database, finally App   Output: Build order: [Logger, Database, App]   5. Garbage Collection &amp; Resource Cleanup  Purpose: Cleaning up system resources in proper order  Why Postorder: Child resources must be freed before parent resources  Example:     Input: Process tree with parent and child processes   Process: Terminate child processes first, then parent processes   Output: Clean shutdown without orphaned processes   6. Bottom-up Tree Calculations  Purpose: Computing values that depend on children’s computed values  Why Postorder: Parent calculations need children’s results  Example:     Input: Employee hierarchy with salary calculations   Process: Calculate team budgets bottom-up   Output:     Employee A: $50K Employee B: $60K   Manager: $110K (team total) Director: $170K (includes manager + own salary)           7. Game Object Destruction  Purpose: Destroying game objects and their components in correct order  Why Postorder: Child objects must be destroyed before parent containers  Example:     Input: Character with weapons, armor, and inventory items   Process: Destroy items first, then equipment, finally character   Output: Clean game object removal without references to destroyed objects   8. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Code Generation  Purpose: Generating assembly or machine code from expression trees  Why Postorder: Operands must be loaded before operations can be performed  Example:     Input: Expression tree for “a + b * c”   Process:     LOAD b LOAD c   MULTIPLY LOAD a ADD           Output: Stack-based code where operands are processed before operators   9. Tree Validation &amp; Structure Checking  Purpose: Validating tree properties by checking children first  Why Postorder: Parent validity often depends on children being valid  Example:     Input: Binary tree to check if it’s a complete binary tree   Process: Validate leaf nodes first, then internal nodes, finally root   Output: Boolean result after checking all subtrees   10. Tree Transformation &amp; Reconstruction  Purpose: Converting tree structures while preserving relationships  Why Postorder: Children must be transformed before parent transformation can occur  Example:     Input: Parse tree to be converted to different format   Process: Transform leaf nodes first, then internal nodes, finally root   Output: Transformed tree maintaining structural integrity   11. UI Component Disposal  Purpose: Properly disposing user interface components and their resources  Why Postorder: Child UI elements must be disposed before parent containers  Example:     Input: Window with buttons, text fields, and panels   Process: Dispose buttons and text fields first, then panels, finally window   Output: Clean UI shutdown without memory leaks   12. Database Transaction Rollback  Purpose: Rolling back nested transactions in reverse order  Why Postorder: Inner transactions must be rolled back before outer transactions  Example:     Input: Nested transaction tree with savepoints   Process: Rollback deepest savepoints first, then parent transactions   Output: Database restored to consistent state before transaction began   ⏱️ Complexity:     Time: O(n)   Space: O(h)     Breadth-First Traversal  Breadth-first traversal (BFS) explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.   Level Order Traversal  Level order traversal is a type of breadth-first traversal where nodes are visited level by level, starting from the root and moving left to right.   Order: Level by level, left to right   Think of it as: “Visit everyone at my level, then go to the next level”   🔧 Algorithm:  levelOrder(root):     if root is null:         return          queue = new Queue()     queue.enqueue(root)          while queue is not empty:         node = queue.dequeue()         visit(node)                     // ✅ Process current node                  if node.left is not null:       // 📥 Add left child to queue             queue.enqueue(node.left)         if node.right is not null:      // 📥 Add right child to queue             queue.enqueue(node.right)   Level Order Result: A → B → C → D → E → F → G   Use Cases &amp; Applications:   1. Tree Printing &amp; Visualization  Purpose: Displaying tree structure level by level for easy understanding  Why Level Order: Natural visual representation matches how humans perceive hierarchies  Example:     Input: Company organization tree   Process: Print CEO first, then VPs, then managers, then employees   Output:     Level 0: [CEO] Level 1: [VP Sales, VP Engineering]   Level 2: [Sales Manager, Dev Manager, QA Manager] Level 3: [Sales Rep 1, Sales Rep 2, Developer 1, Developer 2, Tester 1]           2. Shortest Path &amp; Minimum Depth Finding  Purpose: Finding shortest distance or minimum steps to reach a target  Why Level Order: BFS guarantees finding shortest path first  Example:     Input: Family tree, find shortest relationship between two people   Process: Explore immediate family first, then extended family   Output: “Alice and Bob are cousins (3 steps apart)” vs “Alice and Charlie are siblings (2 steps apart)”   3. Tree Width &amp; Level Analysis  Purpose: Finding maximum width and analyzing tree structure per level  Why Level Order: Processes entire levels at once for width calculation  Example:     Input: Website navigation menu tree   Process: Count items at each menu level   Output:     Level 1: 3 main categories (Home, Products, About) Level 2: 8 subcategories (max width = 8) Level 3: 12 specific pages           4. Tree Serialization &amp; Level-wise Storage  Purpose: Storing tree data in level-order format for reconstruction  Why Level Order: Enables breadth-first reconstruction and balanced loading  Example:     Input: Binary tree [A, B, C, D, E, null, F]   Process: Store nodes level by level with null markers                                   Output: “A           B,C           D,E,null,F           null,null,null,null” (levels separated by           )                           5. Priority Processing &amp; Urgent Task Handling  Purpose: Processing items by priority levels (urgent first, then important, then normal)  Why Level Order: Higher priority levels processed completely before lower ones  Example:     Input: Hospital patient queue with priority levels   Process:     Level 1 (Critical): [Heart Attack, Stroke] Level 2 (Urgent): [Broken Bone, Deep Cut]   Level 3 (Normal): [Check-up, Vaccination]           Output: All critical patients treated first, then urgent, then normal   6.
