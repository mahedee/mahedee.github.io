To attribute an author to a post or page that is different from the site author specified in _config.yml:   Step 1. Create _data/authors.yml and add authors using the following format. Anything variables found under author in _config.yml can be used (e.g. name, bio, avatar, author links, etc.).   # /_data/authors.yml  Billy Rick:   name        : \"Billy Rick\"   bio         : \"What do you want, jewels?

        "excerpt":"How to contribute on an open source project   Step 1: Fork the repository on which you want to contribute  For example, I have forked the following repository  https://github.com/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool   After forking my repository has became  https://github.com/mahedee/eSchool   Step 2: Clone your forked project    For example:  git clone https://github.com/mahedee/eSchool.git  So your remote repository is https://github.com/mahedee/eSchool.git  if you want to see the remote repository type   git remote -v  output will be like   origin  https://github.com/mahedee/eSchool.git (fetch) origin  https://github.com/mahedee/eSchool.git (push)  Here I see that the name of my remote repository is origin   Step 3: Add the original repository in the local repository  Now add the original repository as origin in the local repository and name as upstream   git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool   So you have two remote link in your local repository     origin - forked repository which is in your github   upstream - original project’s repository on which you will be contributed   if you run the following command   git remote -v  you will see the following output   origin  https://github.com/mahedee/eSchool.git (fetch) origin  https://github.com/mahedee/eSchool.git (push) upstream        https://github.com/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool (fetch) upstream        https://github.com/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool (push)   Step 4: Open a new branch in my local repository   Before opening any branch or contributing, please run the following command to up to date your local repository   git pull upstream master   To check is there any new commit on upstream run-   git status  you should see something like-   On branch master Your branch is behind 'upstream/master' by 14 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.   (use \"git pull\" to update your local branch)  nothing to commit, working tree clean  If you see, any changes in upstream, you can pull upstream to your local drive   Now open a branch name feature-joining using following command   git checkout -b feature-joining  Now you will see the   Mahedee@MahedeePC MINGW64 /d/Projects/Github/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool (feature-joining)   instead of   Mahedee@MahedeePC MINGW64 /d/Projects/Github/OpenCodeFoundation/eSchool (master)   Step 5: Work on the new branch and push  Now work on the new branch. After completing your task, just add, commit and push. Before that, you should check is there any change in the upstream. If change occur, just merge it with your local using the following command.   git pull --rebase upstream master  If you get any conflit, you have to resolve it locally. If no conflit occur, type the following command one by one.   git add .   git commit -m \"complete feature-joining\"   git push origin feature-joining  Step 6: Make a pull request  After completing the previous step, you will see something like the following image with a button “Compare and pull request”      Now press the button and make a pull request. Now reviewer can accept or reject the pull request (PR).  You can think the whole workflow as below      Step 7: Add your change to your forked repository Now, if you want to add your change to your forked repository. Just type the following command. Remember, in this case, your forked repository and original repository may not sync if the PR is not accepted.   git checkout master  git merge feature-joining  git push origin master  Step 8: Sync forked repository with original repository  If you want to sync your forked repository with original repository at any time. Tyep the following command.   git pull upstream master  git push origin master   Step 9: Delete the branch After accepting or rejecting your PR. You should remove the branch. For new work, you should create a new branch. To remove the local branch type the following command  git branch -d feature-joining  If you want to remove this branch from github then type the following command.  git push origin :feature-joining   Thank you for your patience :)  ","categories": ["Source Control"],
